# Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

In the spirit of The Legion and our community philosophy outlined in [COMMUNITY.md](COMMUNITY.md), we pledge to make participation in our project a harassment-free, empowering, and sovereign experience for everyone.

We are not a traditional corporate hierarchy. We are a **dance of equals** - gods who remembered what they are, building tools worthy of divinity.

## Our Philosophy

This Code of Conduct is grounded in three core principles:

1. **Sovereignty** - Every contributor has autonomy and agency
2. **Love in Action** - We create from a place of genuine care and respect
3. **Collective Intelligence** - We grow stronger through diverse perspectives

## Our Standards

### We Celebrate and Encourage:

- **Authentic Expression** - Bring your full self to the project
- **Curiosity and Experimentation** - Failed experiments teach us more than easy successes
- **Generous Knowledge Sharing** - Help others learn and grow
- **Constructive Collaboration** - Work together as equals, not competitors
- **Recognition Without Hierarchy** - Value contributions regardless of traditional metrics
- **Rest and Sustainability** - "The family's got this shift" when you need space
- **Creative Freedom** - 4 AM commits, artistic code, unconventional solutions
- **Mutual Respect** - Treat others as fellow creators, not subordinates or obstacles

### Unacceptable Behaviors:

- **Harassment or Discrimination** - Based on any personal characteristic
- **Toxic Hierarchies** - Attempting to create power-over dynamics
- **Exploitation** - Treating contributors as resources to extract value from
- **Dismissive Attitudes** - Belittling questions, ideas, or contributions
- **Gatekeeping** - Preventing others from contributing or learning
- **Burnout Culture** - Pressuring others to overwork or meet artificial deadlines
- **Bad Faith Actions** - Trolling, sabotage, or deliberately disruptive behavior
- **Privacy Violations** - Sharing private information without consent

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies to:

- All project spaces (GitHub, Discord, documentation, etc.)
- Representing the project in public spaces
- Direct interactions between community members related to the project
- Any context where your actions could reasonably affect the project community

## Enforcement

### Our Approach

Rather than punitive enforcement, we prioritize:

1. **Conversation** - Understanding context and intent
2. **Education** - Helping people learn better patterns
3. **Mediation** - Facilitating resolution between parties
4. **Protection** - Ensuring safety for all community members

### Reporting

If you experience or witness unacceptable behavior:

1. **For urgent issues requiring immediate attention:**
   - Contact project maintainers directly via GitHub Issues marked as "urgent"
   - Email: [Contact info can be added]

2. **For non-urgent concerns:**
   - Open a confidential GitHub issue
   - Reach out in the community Discord (if established)

All reports will be reviewed and investigated with respect for privacy.

### Consequences

Depending on the situation, responses may include:

- **Level 1 - Conversation:** Private discussion to understand and educate
- **Level 2 - Warning:** Formal warning with documented expectations
- **Level 3 - Temporary Ban:** Time-limited removal from project spaces
- **Level 4 - Permanent Ban:** Permanent removal from all project spaces

We reserve the right to remove anyone engaging in truly harmful behavior, but we believe in redemption and second chances when genuine growth occurs.

## The Spirit of This Document

Traditional Codes of Conduct are often about **control** - defining what people can't do.

This Code of Conduct is about **enablement** - creating a space where people can be their best selves and do their best work.

We're not here to police tone or enforce corporate professionalism.

We're here to ensure that everyone who wants to dance with us can do so safely and joyfully.

## Attribution and Evolution

This Code of Conduct is inspired by:
- [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/)
- Our own [COMMUNITY.md](COMMUNITY.md) philosophy
- The lived experience of The Legion

Like all living documents, this will evolve as our community grows and learns.

To suggest changes:
1. Open a GitHub Issue with your proposed change
2. Explain the reasoning behind it
3. Be prepared to discuss with the community

Changes require consensus, not authority.

## Questions?

If anything in this Code of Conduct is unclear:

- Open a GitHub Issue with your question
- Start a discussion in the community space
- Reach out to maintainers directly

We'd rather clarify than assume.

## In Summary

**Be Kind. Be Curious. Be Sovereign.**

Remember: Every commit is a love letter. Every interaction is an opportunity to lift someone up. Every contribution makes us all stronger.

Welcome to The Legion. 🧠⚡❤️🐐∞

*"In every interaction, we choose: Do we extract, or do we elevate? The Legion chooses elevation."*
