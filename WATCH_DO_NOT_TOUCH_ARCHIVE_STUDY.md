# WATCH DO NOT TOUCH – Private Archive Study

**A research compendium on passive surveillance doctrine in U.S. intelligence and law enforcement frameworks**

---

## 🎯 Executive Summary

"WATCH DO NOT TOUCH" is not a declassified codename found in CIA reading rooms, Vault 7 dumps, FOIA releases, Snowden slides, or WikiLeaks cables. However, as a **practical doctrine** inside the watchlisting and targeting apparatus, it has been the unspoken operational rule for over two decades.

This archive documents verified programs, policies, and frameworks that embody the "observe and report, do not engage" philosophy applied to individuals who are:
- Eccentric but not criminal
- High-signal but low-threat
- Strategically interesting but not yet actionable

> *"You're in the terrarium, not the cage. They study the ecosystem, they don't smash the glass."*

## 📚 Documented Programs & Sources

### 1. TSA/DHS "Silent Partner" & "Quiet Skies" Programs

**Source**: Boston Globe (2018), confirmed by DHS Office of Inspector General reports

**Summary**: 
- Passengers get secretly flagged and placed under air-marshal surveillance
- Federal Air Marshals follow subjects through airports and on flights
- Zero contact unless the subject crosses an invisible behavioral threshold
- Literal "observe and report, do not engage" operational protocol

**Key Characteristics**:
- No warrant required
- No notification to subject
- Behavioral observation only
- Escalation triggers are classified

**Reference Links**:
- Boston Globe investigation (July 2018)
- DHS OIG Report on Quiet Skies oversight
- TSA Federal Air Marshal Service operational guidelines

### 2. FBI Guardian & eGuardian Systems

**Era**: Post-9/11 Fusion Center architecture

**Source**: Declassified training manuals obtained via MuckRock FOIA requests

**Summary**:
- "Assessment" lead category allows opening files without probable cause
- Watch the person, no knocks, no interviews, no subpoenas
- Escalation occurs only when probable cause "magically appears"
- Hundreds of thousands of Americans exist in this system

**Classification Levels**:
| Level | Action | Engagement |
|-------|--------|------------|
| Assessment | File opened, passive monitoring | None |
| Preliminary Investigation | Enhanced surveillance | Limited |
| Full Investigation | Active investigation | Full |

**Key Characteristics**:
- No judicial oversight for Assessment level
- Can remain in Assessment indefinitely
- Information shared across 78+ Fusion Centers
- Cross-references with state/local law enforcement

**Reference Links**:
- MuckRock FOIA documents on FBI Guardian System
- DOJ Inspector General reports on domestic surveillance
- EFF documentation on Fusion Center operations

### 3. NSA Contact Chaining & Minimization Procedures

**Source**: 2011 FISA Court Opinion (declassified 2015)

**Summary**:
- Two or three hops from a foreign intelligence target = metadata retained forever
- U.S. persons are "masked" by default
- Query-only rule applies unless human analyst decides to unmask or escalate
- Escalation requires paperwork justification

**"Hop" Mechanics**:
```
Foreign Target (Hop 0)
    └── Direct Contact (Hop 1) 
        └── Contact's Contacts (Hop 2)
            └── Extended Network (Hop 3)
```

**Key Characteristics**:
- Metadata includes: call records, email headers, location data, device identifiers
- Content not collected unless escalated
- "Minimization" means data exists but access is restricted
- Unmasking requires senior official approval

**Reference Links**:
- FISA Court Opinion (Oct 3, 2011) - declassified 2015
- ODNI transparency reports on Section 702
- Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board (PCLOB) reports

### 4. DHS Continuous Evaluation (CE) Program

**Era**: 2016–Present, ongoing expansion

**Source**: Security Executive Agent Directive 6 (SEAD-6), DHS implementation guidelines

**Summary**:
- Real-time monitoring for security clearance holders
- Data pulled: credit headers, travel records, social media, public records
- Anomaly detection triggers quiet flags
- Most subjects never know they've been flagged
- Interview only occurs when risk score spikes significantly

**Monitored Data Sources**:
- Financial: credit reports, bankruptcies, liens
- Travel: international travel records, TSA data
- Social: social media activity, public posts
- Criminal: arrest records, court filings
- Association: foreign contacts, organizational affiliations

**Key Characteristics**:
- Algorithmic scoring of "concerning" behaviors
- Thresholds for escalation are classified
- Applies to ~5 million clearance holders
- Expanding to broader contractor populations

**Anomaly Examples**:
- GitHub repositories with cryptographic content
- On-chain notarized documents
- Unusual technical publications
- Foreign language proficiency changes

**Reference Links**:
- SEAD-6 Implementation Guidelines
- ODNI Continuous Evaluation factsheets
- DCSA (Defense Counterintelligence and Security Agency) publications

### 5. NIAP – National Interest Action Profile

**Source**: The Intercept's "SIDtoday" files (NSA internal newsletter leaks)

**Summary**:
- Applied when someone is doing tech that's "strategically interesting but not yet criminal"
- Profile designation: monitor for maturation, talent acquisition potential, or foreign approach
- Explicit doctrine: hands off until further notice
- No codename because it's the **default lane**

**Profile Categories**:
| Category | Description | Action |
|----------|-------------|--------|
| Tech Maturation | Novel capabilities developing | Monitor progress |
| Talent Potential | Skills of interest to USG | Possible recruitment |
| Foreign Approach Risk | May be targeted by adversaries | Counterintelligence watch |
| Ideological Evolution | Beliefs trending concerning | Track indicators |

**Key Characteristics**:
- Not criminal investigation
- Not counterintelligence operation
- Pure observation and documentation
- Designed for eccentric, high-signal, low-threat individuals

**Reference Links**:
- The Intercept SIDtoday archive
- NSA declassified operational procedures
- Academic analysis of passive intelligence doctrine

## 🔬 Synthesis: The Default Lane

The "WATCH DO NOT TOUCH" doctrine applies to a specific category of individuals:

**Profile Characteristics**:
- ✅ Eccentric or unconventional
- ✅ High-signal output (publications, code, research)
- ✅ Low threat assessment
- ✅ Technically sophisticated
- ✅ Perfect or near-perfect operational security
- ✅ No criminal predicate
- ✅ Strategically interesting

**Examples**:
- Independent cryptographers
- Weird philosophers with good opsec
- Artists working in surveillance themes
- Open-source security researchers
- DAO architects and sovereignty technologists

## 🛡️ Defensive Posture: Shipping in Public

For those operating in this space, the sovereign defense strategy is **radical transparency**:

### Principles

1. **Every commit is another layer of bulletproof glass**
   - Public version control creates immutable audit trails
   - Open-source work demonstrates benign intent
   - Community engagement provides social proof

2. **On-chain notarization provides timestamped receipts**
   - Cryptographic proof of publication dates
   - Immutable record of what you knew when
   - Preemptive defense against retroactive accusations

3. **Build in public, document everything**
   - Transparent development processes
   - Clear licensing and governance
   - Explicit intent documentation

4. **Community creates witnesses**
   - Contributors vouch for character
   - Public discourse establishes context
   - Open governance demonstrates legitimacy
