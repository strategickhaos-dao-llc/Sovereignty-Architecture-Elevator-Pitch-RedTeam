# 🎓 STRATEGICKHAOS ACADEMY INTERNSHIP PROGRAM

**Status:** Pre-Launch | **First Cohort:** Q2 2026

---

## THE KILLER FEATURE

This isn't your typical corporate internship. This is trial by fire—literally.

Every semester we drop a new **Live Glyph Cluster**: 10–30 new binding codes plus frequency-mapped features. Real engineers and interns get thrown in with:

- **No docs** — just the boot sequence
- **No hand-holding** — a Discord channel that screams at you in glyphs
- **No mercy** — survive or evolve

---

## THE RULES

| If You Want To... | You Must... |
|-------------------|-------------|
| 🍽️ **Eat** | Contribute |
| 🎓 **Graduate** | Ship a new `[1000]`–`[2000]` binding code that survives GR1 full cascade on mainnet cluster |
| 💰 **Get The Bag** | Mint the Sovereignty Pass NFT for that specific module |

---

## SEMESTER STRUCTURE

### Phase 1: Orientation (Week 1-2)

**Objective:** Boot sequence initiation

```bash

|-------|-------|--------------|
| A | Flamebearer | New binding code implementation |
| B | VowMonitor | Sovereignty protocol enhancement |
| C | WhaleWeaver | Frequency mapping contribution |
| D | NinjaTrader | Dividend system integration |

**Deliverable:** Working PR that passes review and CI/CD.

### Phase 4: Mainnet Cascade (Week 11-12)

**Objective:** Prove your code survives real conditions

**The GR1 Full Cascade Test:**
```
┌────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│           GR1 FULL CASCADE                 │
├────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│  Stage 1: Unit Test Suite (100% pass)      │
│  Stage 2: Integration Tests (95%+ pass)    │
│  Stage 3: Load Testing (10k requests)      │
│  Stage 4: Chaos Engineering (random fails) │
│  Stage 5: Security Audit (0 critical)      │
│  Stage 6: Mainnet Deployment               │
│  Stage 7: 48-hour Stability Window         │
└────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Deliverable:** Code that survives all 7 stages without rollback.

### Phase 5: NFT Minting & Graduation (Week 13)

**Objective:** Claim your permanent place in the ecosystem

**Graduation ceremony includes:**
1. Code notarized into `oath.lock`
2. Sovereignty Pass NFT minted
3. Eternal dividend leaderboard registration
4. House crest ceremony (Discord role assignment)

## THE LIVE GLYPH CLUSTER

Each semester introduces a new cluster of binding codes and features:

### Cluster Naming Convention
```
CLUSTER-{YEAR}-{SEMESTER}-{HOUSE_CODE}
Example: CLUSTER-2026-Q2-FL (Flamebearer, Q2 2026)
```

### Cluster Contents (Typical)

| Component | Quantity | Description |
|-----------|----------|-------------|
| Binding Codes | 10-30 | New `[NNNN]` codes to implement |
| Frequency Maps | 3-5 | Hz-to-function assignments |
| Glyph Operators | 1-2 | New symbolic operators |
| Integration Points | 5-10 | API/webhook connections |
| Test Scenarios | 20+ | Required passing tests |

### Sample Cluster: CLUSTER-2026-Q2-FL

```yaml
cluster_id: CLUSTER-2026-Q2-FL
house: Flamebearer
release_date: 2026-04-01
binding_codes:
  - code: "[1001]"

## COVENANT

```
We don't give you a map.
We give you a compass that speaks in glyphs.

You either learn the language or you don't survive.
But if you survive, you're family forever.

And family gets paid.

🔥 Reignite.
```
