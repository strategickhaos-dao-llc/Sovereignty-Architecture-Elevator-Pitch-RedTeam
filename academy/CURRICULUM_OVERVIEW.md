# 📖 STRATEGICKHAOS ACADEMY CURRICULUM OVERVIEW

**Status:** Active Development | **Launch:** Q2 2026  
**Framework:** Bloom's Taxonomy + Glyph-Based Learning

---

## OVERVIEW

The Strategickhaos Academy curriculum isn't traditional education—it's immersive symbolic engineering. While completing your normal engineering modules, you'll simultaneously learn to speak in glyphs, build sovereign systems, and ascend (literally) while your professor thinks you're just taking notes.

---

## THE BOOT SEQUENCE

Every journey begins the same way:

```bash
# Open a fresh codespace in the enterprise org
# Drop one command:

glyph> GR1 --spawn-hogwarts-cluster-2026
```

**What happens:**
- 40 fresh nodes spin up instantly
- Live RAG loaded with all 27 papers + every invention you forgot about
- Guestbook-1 dispatcher preloaded with JetRider, GetLense
- House-specific AI agents activated and ready

---

## LEARNING PHILOSOPHY

### The No-Docs Approach

Traditional education: Here's the manual, read chapter 1-20, take an exam.

Strategickhaos education: Here's the boot sequence, here's a Discord channel that screams at you in glyphs, figure it out.

**Why this works:**
1. Real-world engineering has no manual
2. Learning by doing creates muscle memory
3. The glyphs themselves are the documentation
4. Community support replaces tutorials

### Bloom's Taxonomy Integration

| Level | Traditional | Strategickhaos |
|-------|-------------|----------------|
| 1. Remember | Memorize facts | Recognize glyph patterns |
| 2. Understand | Explain concepts | Parse binding code semantics |
| 3. Apply | Use in new situations | Execute glyph commands |
| 4. Analyze | Break down components | Reverse-engineer glyph clusters |
| 5. Evaluate | Judge effectiveness | Review peer binding codes |
| 6. Create | Generate new work | Ship new `[1000]`-`[2000]` codes |

## ASSESSMENT & PROGRESSION

### Module Completion

Each module has clear completion criteria:

```yaml
module_completion:
  FL-101:
    criteria:
      - binding_codes_submitted: 5
      - tests_passing: 100%
      - peer_review_received: 1

## COVENANT

```
We don't give you documentation.
We give you a fire and watch you learn to tend it.

The glyphs are the language.
The cascade is the test.
The dividend is the reward.

And if you make it to #glyph-999...
well, that's where the real education begins.

Welcome to Hogwarts, but the sorting hat is a SHA256 hash of your soul
and the dark arts actually pay 7% forever.

Choose your house.
Or burn a new one into existence.

🔥 Reignite.
