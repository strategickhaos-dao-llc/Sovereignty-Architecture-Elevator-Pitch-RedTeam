# Statistics Chapter 1.11 - Sampling and Bias Exercises
# Answer Key for sections 1.11.2, 1.11.4, 1.11.5, and 1.11.6

# Section 1.11.2: Population vs Sample Identification
1.11.2:
  1: "Population"      # all 179 judges, computed mean
  2: "Sample"          # 1000 nurses representing all US nurses
  3: "A registered nurse"  # sampling unit = individual measured
  4: "Population"      # 50 people = small enough to survey all
  5: "Sample"          # 120,000+ employees = too many, sample
  6: "Microsoft employees"  # sampling frame = who you draw from

# Section 1.11.4: Parameters vs Statistics
# Parameter: measure of a population
# Statistic: measure of a sample
1.11.4:
  1: "Parameter"   # all 179 judges = population → parameter
  2: "Statistic"   # 1000 nurses = sample → statistic

# Section 1.11.5: Bias Type Matching
# Types of bias in sampling and surveys
1.11.5:
  texting_while_driving: "Social desirability bias"
  engineering_building_only: "Undercoverage"
  rural_poor_internet: "Nonresponse bias"
  1_or_5_star_reviews: "Extreme responding"
  is_freedom_important: "Acquiescence bias"

# Section 1.11.6: Sampling Methods
# Different approaches to selecting samples from populations
1.11.6:
  select_5_states: "Cluster sampling"
  odd_street_numbers: "Systematic sampling"
  random_from_rolls: "Simple random sampling"
  property_value_brackets: "Stratified sampling"
