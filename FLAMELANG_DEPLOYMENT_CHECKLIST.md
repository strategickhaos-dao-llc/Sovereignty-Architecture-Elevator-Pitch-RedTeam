## Deployment Targets

### LLM Platforms
- [ ] **Claude Chat**: Ready to paste YAML
- [ ] **ChatGPT**: Ready to paste YAML
- [ ] **Grok**: Ready to paste YAML
- [ ] **Gemini**: Ready to paste YAML
- [ ] **Local LLMs**: Ready to integrate

### Usage Scenarios
- [ ] **Interactive Q&A**: Works with demo script
- [ ] **Batch Processing**: Caching implemented
- [ ] **Study Sessions**: Confidence scoring helps
- [ ] **Pattern Learning**: Examples demonstrate usage

## Academic Integrity

- [x] **Disclaimer included**: "INTERNAL DRAFT — NOT LEGAL ADVICE"
- [x] **Use guidelines**: Designed for understanding, not cheating
- [x] **Student responsibility**: Clear in all docs
- [x] **Educational focus**: Pattern recognition and learning

## Post-Deployment Steps

### Immediate (Within 1 week)
- [ ] Test with actual MAT-243 questions
- [ ] Gather accuracy metrics
- [ ] Collect user feedback
- [ ] Track confidence scores

### Short-term (Within 1 month)
- [ ] Add hypothesis testing patterns
- [ ] Add confidence interval patterns
- [ ] Add p-value patterns
- [ ] Extend to 30+ patterns

### Long-term (Within 3 months)
- [ ] Multi-modal support (chart images)
- [ ] Adaptive learning from feedback
- [ ] Extend to other courses
- [ ] Community contributions

## Success Metrics

### Technical Metrics
- [x] **Test Pass Rate**: 10/10 (100%)
- [x] **Pattern Coverage**: 14 rules
- [x] **Code Quality**: Clean, modular, documented
- [x] **Performance**: Caching implemented

### User Metrics (To Track)
- [ ] **Accuracy**: % of correct answers
- [ ] **Confidence Alignment**: High confidence = correct?
- [ ] **Usage Frequency**: Questions per session
- [ ] **Learning Impact**: Understanding improvement

## Known Limitations

### Current Limitations
- **Domain-specific**: Only MAT-243 statistics patterns
- **Text-only**: No image analysis yet
- **English-only**: Question text must be English
- **Pattern-based**: Requires matching known patterns

### Mitigation Strategies
- Add more patterns based on usage
- Implement multi-modal support in future
- Consider multi-language support
- Allow unknown pattern handling

## Rollback Plan

If issues arise:
1. **Minor issues**: Update pattern rules, re-deploy
2. **Major issues**: Revert to previous commit
3. **Critical issues**: Disable deployment, investigate

```bash
# Rollback command
git revert HEAD~1
git push origin copilot/add-flamelang-zybooks-solver
```

## Notes

This is a **semantic pattern compiler** - a real compiler architecture applied to knowledge compilation. The innovation is in treating natural language questions as source code and compiling them into structured decisions using pattern matching.

**Traditional Compiler**: Code → Binary  
**FlameLang Compiler**: Question → Answer

Same architecture. Different domain.
