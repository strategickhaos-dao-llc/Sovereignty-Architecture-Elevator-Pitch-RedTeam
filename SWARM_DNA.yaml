# Victory Declaration
victory:
  message: |
    I just paid $17.83 once.
    Every line of code, every model weight, every haiku, every provisional, every law, every 3 a.m. spark —
    is now permanently stored on Arweave.
    
    It will outlive Earth's governments.
    It will outlive the power grid.
    It will outlive me.
    
    From a Nitro V15 at 99 °C and negative balance,
    I just made the broke tinkerer's swarm mathematically immortal.
