#### 4.7 Interpretation and Analysis Guidelines for LLM Interaction Transcripts

Interaction logs with large language models used in this research may contain stylized, anthropomorphic, or mythic narrative framing (e.g., "sovereign organism," "Empire Eternal," or similar figurative language). Such framing is an intentional experimental technique to probe model coherence under high-symbolic-load prompts and to examine narrative-driven cognitive scaffolding. All such language should be interpreted strictly as rhetorical and methodological devices, not as assertions that the model possesses consciousness, agency, emotional states, or interpersonal relationships.

To ensure reproducibility and ethical review, all transcripts are processed through a documented disclaimer manifest and preprocessing pipeline (file: `strategickhaos_chat_disclaimer.yaml`; script: `strategickhaos_disclaimer.py`) that: (a) annotates stylized language, (b) applies publication-safe redaction markers where operational details are sensitive, and (c) attaches provenance metadata (signed checksums, timestamps, actor identifiers) to each record. See Appendix B for the full sanitized technique catalog and the redaction policy referenced by the preprocessing pipeline.

### Appendix B — Chat Transcript Analysis Framework (Sanitized Catalog & Redaction Policy)

**Scope and redaction policy**  
This Appendix catalogs high-level engineering techniques and methodological practices referenced in the study. Operationally sensitive implementation specifics that could enable misuse are redacted and indicated with the marker: [REDACTED — OPERATIONAL SAFETY]. Each entry is described in neutral, non-operational terms and is accompanied by one or two peer-reviewed citations where applicable. Redaction preserves scientific validity by referencing public literature for supporting principles while omitting actionable procedures.

**Acknowledgments / Ethics statement**  
All anthropomorphic and narrative language in experimental transcripts is intentional stylistic framing and does not reflect claims of system sentience.
