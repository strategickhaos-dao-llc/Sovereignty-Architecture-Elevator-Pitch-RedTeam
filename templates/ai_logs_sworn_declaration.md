## SWORN DECLARATION UNDER PENALTY OF PERJURY

**DECLARATION OF [YOUR NAME]**

I, **[YOUR FULL NAME]**, declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of **[STATE/JURISDICTION]** that the following is true and correct:

### 1. Personal Background and Authority

1.1. I am over the age of 18 and competent to make this declaration.

1.2. I am the **[YOUR TITLE/ROLE]** of **[ORGANIZATION NAME]**, and I have personal knowledge of the facts stated in this declaration.

1.3. I am the custodian of records for the AI research and development ledger described herein.

### 2. Nature of the Records

2.1. As part of my regular responsibilities, I maintain a systematic ledger of AI interactions, outputs, and research activities (the "**AI Ledger**").

2.2. The AI Ledger is kept in the regular course of **[ORGANIZATION NAME]**'s research and development operations.

2.3. It is the regular practice of **[ORGANIZATION NAME]** to maintain such records contemporaneously with the activities they document.

### 3. Record-Keeping Practices

3.1. **Timing:** Entries are made at or near the time of each AI interaction or output, typically within **[TIME PERIOD, e.g., "minutes", "hours", or "days"]** of the event.

3.2. **Method:** Records are maintained using the following methods:
- Git version control with cryptographic commit signing (GPG)
- SHA3 hash chains for integrity verification
- Screenshots of AI outputs
- Preservation of share URLs when available
- Structured YAML/JSON metadata

3.3. **Consistency:** This record-keeping practice has been followed systematically since **[START DATE]**.

### 4. Authentication of Specific Records

4.1. I have reviewed the records attached as **Exhibit [A/B/C]** to this declaration.

4.2. These records are true and accurate copies of entries from the AI Ledger.

4.3. I personally observed and documented the AI outputs described in these records.

4.4. The cryptographic signatures and hashes in these records are authentic and were generated by the systems under my control and supervision.

### 5. Integrity and Security

5.1. The AI Ledger is stored in a secure repository with:
- Version control (Git)
- Cryptographic commit signing (GPG key: **[YOUR KEY ID]**)
- Hash chain verification (SHA3)
- Regular backups

5.2. Access to the ledger is restricted to authorized personnel.

5.3. The ledger has not been altered except through documented, signed commits that preserve the complete history.

### 6. Specific Attestations

6.1. **Observed Outputs:** I personally observed the AI outputs documented in **[SPECIFIC ENTRIES/DATES]**.

6.2. **No Modifications:** The outputs were captured as-generated without modification, except where explicitly noted in the metadata.

6.3. **Context Preservation:** All relevant context, prompts, and parameters are preserved in the ledger entries.

6.4. **Timestamp Accuracy:** All timestamps in the ledger accurately reflect when the AI interactions occurred, to the best of my knowledge and based on system time synchronization.

### 7. Technical Verification

7.1. The cryptographic signatures can be verified using my public GPG key, available at:
   - **Key ID:** [YOUR GPG KEY ID]
   - **Fingerprint:** [YOUR GPG KEY FINGERPRINT]
   - **Public Key:** [URL OR KEYSERVER REFERENCE]

7.2. Hash chain integrity can be verified by recalculating SHA3 hashes from the ledger data.

7.3. Git commit history provides an immutable audit trail of all changes to the ledger.

### 8. Business Records Declaration

8.1. These records qualify as business records under **[APPLICABLE RULE, e.g., "Federal Rule of Evidence 803(6)" or equivalent]** because:
   - They are made in the regular course of business
   - It is the regular practice to make such records
   - They are made at or near the time of the events
   - They are made by persons with knowledge
   - I am a qualified custodian of these records

### 9. Conclusion

I declare under penalty of perjury that the foregoing is true and correct to the best of my knowledge, information, and belief.

## Instructions for Use

### Before Signing
1. Fill in all bracketed fields **[LIKE THIS]** with your specific information
2. Attach relevant ledger entries as exhibits
3. Ensure all referenced cryptographic keys and hashes are accurate
4. Review with legal counsel if possible

### Signing Process
1. Print this declaration on organization letterhead if available
2. Sign in the presence of a notary public (recommended but not always required)
3. Attach the original to your evidence submission
4. Keep copies for your records

### What This Achieves
- **9.5/10 admissibility strength** when combined with:
  - GPG-signed commits
  - SHA3 hash chains
  - Screenshots and share URLs
  - Regular record-keeping practices

### Legal Basis
- Federal Rule of Evidence 803(6) - Business Records Exception
- State equivalents in all 50 US states
- International business records exceptions
- Party admission doctrine (for screenshots/URLs)
