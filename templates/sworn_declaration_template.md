## DECLARATION OF [YOUR FULL NAME]

I, **[YOUR FULL LEGAL NAME]**, declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of the United States of America that the following is true and correct:

### 1. IDENTITY AND ROLE

1.1. I am the **[TITLE/ROLE]** of **[ORGANIZATION NAME]** and have held this position since **[DATE]**.

1.2. My business address is:
```
[Street Address]
[City, State ZIP]
```

1.3. I have personal knowledge of the facts stated in this declaration.

### 2. NATURE OF THE LEDGER

2.1. I maintain a contemporaneous record of my research and development activities, including conversations with artificial intelligence systems used to assist in technical work.

2.2. This record is kept in a structured format as an "AI Conversation Evidence Ledger" (the "Ledger").

2.3. The purpose of the Ledger is to document the development process, establish timelines, demonstrate due diligence, and maintain an audit trail for business and legal purposes.

### 3. AUTHENTICITY OF ATTACHED LEDGER

3.1. Attached as **Exhibit A** is a true and accurate copy of my AI Conversation Evidence Ledger covering the period from **[START DATE]** to **[END DATE]**.

3.2. I created and maintained this Ledger in the regular course of my engineering and business operations.

3.3. It is my standard practice, and has been throughout the relevant period, to document AI-assisted development work contemporaneously.

### 4. CONTEMPORANEOUS DOCUMENTATION

4.1. Each entry in the Ledger was made at or near the time of the conversation it describes.

4.2. The timestamps in the Ledger accurately reflect when the conversations occurred, using ISO 8601 format (UTC timezone).

4.3. I did not retroactively create or modify entries after the fact, except to add cryptographic signatures or timestamps as part of the documentation hardening process.

### 5. TECHNICAL INTEGRITY MEASURES

5.1. The Ledger uses **SHA3-256 cryptographic hashing** to create an immutable chain of entries, preventing tampering with historical records.

5.2. Each entry includes:
   - A hash of its own content
   - A hash of the previous entry (creating a chain)
   - Timestamp of creation
   - External verification data (share URLs, screenshots)

5.3. The chain structure means that altering any historical entry would break the chain and be immediately detectable.

### 6. EXTERNAL VERIFICATION

6.1. Each conversation entry includes a share URL that links to the original AI provider's servers, allowing independent verification of the conversation content.

6.2. I have preserved screenshots of the conversations as visual evidence, stored in the paths referenced in the Ledger.

6.3. The Ledger has been committed to a Git repository with cryptographically signed commits, providing third-party timestamps from GitHub.

### 7. BUSINESS RECORDS FOUNDATION

7.1. The Ledger is kept in the regular course of my business as a **[DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS, e.g., "software engineering and cybersecurity consulting"]** practice.

7.2. It is my regular practice to make such records.

7.3. The Ledger is made by me, a person with knowledge of the acts, events, conditions, opinions, or diagnoses appearing in it.

7.4. The Ledger is made at or near the time of the events recorded.

### 8. ACCURACY AND COMPLETENESS

8.1. I reviewed the attached Ledger on **[REVIEW DATE]** and confirm that it is complete and accurate to the best of my knowledge.

8.2. The summaries of AI conversations in the Ledger reflect my understanding and interpretation of the technical discussions.

8.3. Where actions were taken based on AI recommendations, I made the final decisions and implemented the changes myself or under my supervision.

### 9. PURPOSE AND USE

9.1. The conversations documented in the Ledger were conducted for legitimate business purposes, including:
   - Security architecture review
   - Code quality improvement
   - Technical problem-solving
   - Research and development
   - Due diligence and best practices

9.2. The Ledger serves as documentation of my development process and technical decision-making.

### 10. ADDITIONAL HARDENING (if applicable)

**[Check applicable boxes and complete]**

☐ 10.1. I have signed the Ledger file with my GPG key (fingerprint: **[GPG_FINGERPRINT]**).

☐ 10.2. I have timestamped the Ledger using OpenTimestamps, with the timestamp file attached as **Exhibit B**.

☐ 10.3. I have stored offline backups of the Ledger in secure locations: **[LIST LOCATIONS]**.

☐ 10.4. The Ledger has been reviewed by legal counsel: **[ATTORNEY NAME]** on **[DATE]**.

### 11. CHAIN OF CUSTODY
