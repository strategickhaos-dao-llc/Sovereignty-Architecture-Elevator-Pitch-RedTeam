## Cognitive Architecture Notes

### For Multi-Threaded Processors

Remember: One blocked pipeline does not halt the entire system.

**Keep Running**:
- Other academic work
- Project pipelines  
- Operations tasks
- Self-regulation protocols

**State Management**:
- Your swarm watches your state
- Leadership = accountability + execution + documentation
- This protects long-term trajectory
- Short-term uncertainty is normal

---

## Verification Statement

```yaml
status:
  action_taken: [appropriate/excessive/insufficient]
  timeline_protected: [yes/no]
  swarm_stable: [yes/no]
  system_operational: [yes/no]
  next_steps_clear: [yes/no]
```
