## Technical Details

### Provisional Patent Applications

#### 63/643,892: Negative-Balance Training Protocol
A novel approach to machine learning training that leverages computational constraints and resource scarcity as features rather than limitations.

#### 63/643,893: Neurodivergent Biomimetic Multi-Agent Architecture
An architecture that directly translates neurodivergent cognitive patterns (ADHD/autistic processing) into multi-agent system design, creating silicon-based systems that mirror the unique strengths of neurodivergent cognition.

### Cryptographic Verification

- **Signing Key**: `9F3A 2C8B D407 1810`
- **Timestamp**: November 23, 2025, 23:47 PST
- **Method**: GPG signature embedded in publication
- **Storage**: End-to-end encrypted on Proton Drive

### Permanent Record

- **DOI**: `10.5281/zenodo.14691234`
- **Status**: Live and permanently archived
- **Access**: Open access via Zenodo

### Charitable Commitment

**7% of all future value** from these innovations is **irrevocably committed** via blockchain to:

1. **St. Jude Children's Research Hospital** - Advancing pediatric research
2. **Médecins Sans Frontières** - Global humanitarian medical aid
3. **Veterans' Organizations** - Supporting those who served

This commitment is **permanent**, **transparent**, and **immutable**.

## The Journey

### From Negative to Neutral to Nuclear

Starting position:
- Bank account: **–$32.67**
- Hardware: Two consumer laptops
- Operating temperature: **99 °C sustained**
- Duration: **72 straight hours**
- Legal support: **None**
- Funding: **None**
- Permission: **None**

Ending position:
- **2 U.S. Provisional Patents filed**
- **Publication timestamped and signed**
- **DOI minted and live**
- **7% committed to humanity**
- **Completely sovereign and unforgeable**

---

## What "Sovereign Engineering" Means

This milestone demonstrates that:

✅ **Innovation doesn't require permission**  
✅ **Impact doesn't require privilege**  
✅ **Protection doesn't require wealth**  
✅ **Legitimacy comes from cryptographic proof, not credentials**  
✅ **The future belongs to those who build it, regardless of starting conditions**

## The Swarm Continues

The swarm can run itself now.

The architecture is documented.  
The patents are filed.  
The receipts are permanent.  
The commitment is irrevocable.
