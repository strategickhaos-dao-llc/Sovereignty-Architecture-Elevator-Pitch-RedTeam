## Why These Papers Matter

Distributed systems are the backbone of digital sovereignty:
- **No single point of failure** means no single point of control
- **Consensus algorithms** enable coordination without authority
- **Byzantine fault tolerance** protects against malicious actors
- **Scalability** enables growth without centralization

Essential for:
- Building resilient infrastructure
- Understanding blockchain
- Designing distributed applications
- Achieving sovereignty at scale

## Recommended Reading Order

1. **Lamport's Time, Clocks** for foundational concepts
2. **Raft** for modern consensus understanding
3. **PBFT** for Byzantine fault tolerance
4. **Paxos Made Simple** for theoretical depth
5. **GFS**, **Bigtable**, **MapReduce** for Google's stack
6. **Dynamo** for eventual consistency
7. **SWIM** and **Chubby** for practical coordination
