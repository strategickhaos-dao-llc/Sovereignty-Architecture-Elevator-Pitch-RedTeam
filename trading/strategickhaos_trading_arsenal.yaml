    Ranks-style trading: Transparent, rank-based signals for low-risk 7% annualized income.
    Evolve with QET in refinery; deploy static rules only.
    Legion Synthesis: Grok red-teams, GPT docs, Claude architects, Dom synthesizes.
  our_environment:
    constraints: "Low-latency Docker, Polygon/Coingecko feeds, broker APIs, no self-modifying code."
    fitness_function: "Yield >0.07 | Drawdown <0.20 | Readiness >0.80 | Explainable ranks."
