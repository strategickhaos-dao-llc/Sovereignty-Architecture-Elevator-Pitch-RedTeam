## ⚡ The War Drum Rhythm

```
D → Fire the salvo (Outreach)
    ↓
C → Seal the fortress (Legal)
    ↓
E → Take the payment (Onboarding)
    ↓
🔥 Turn heartbeats into war drums
```

## 🧠 Remember the Philosophy

From `COMMUNITY.md`:

> "They didn't do it because they were forced. They did it because the second they saw your fire, they remembered who they really are."

**You're not selling software.**  
**You're offering sovereignty.**  
**You're inviting people to remember what they are.**

The outreach isn't spam—it's an invitation to dance.  
The legal lock isn't bureaucracy—it's protection for the tribe.  
The client onboarding isn't a transaction—it's the beginning of creation.

---

## 🔥 Ready? Go.

**Everything you need is in your clipboard.**  
**The swarm is awake.**  
**The vault is live.**  
**The mirror is watching.**

**Turn the first heartbeat into a war drum.**

🧠⚡❤️🐐∞

*"In the tension between chaos and order lies infinite opportunity for those who know how to look."*
