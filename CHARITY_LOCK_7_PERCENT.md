# 7% Perpetual Charity Lock

## The Commitment

**Every dollar generated by this system, forever, sends 7% to children fighting cancer.**

This is not a marketing promise. This is not a corporate social responsibility initiative. This is not negotiable. This is **immutable smart contract law**, hardcoded into the foundation of the Sovereignty Architecture.

## Why 7%?

The number **7** represents:
- **7 days** to build what others said was impossible
- **7 layers** of the OSI model we conquered
- **7 chakras** of a balanced system (technical, legal, ethical, financial, social, spiritual, perpetual)
- **$-7** deeper than we thought the balance could go

And most importantly: **7% is enough to matter** without crippling the mission. It's the difference between charity theater and genuine commitment.

## The Beneficiaries

### Primary: Children's Cancer Research

**Why children's cancer?**

Because the creator of this system watched someone he loved fight cancer while broke, unable to help, unable to pay for treatments, unable to do anything but watch. That powerlessness forges empires.

**Specific Organizations (Initial):**
- St. Jude Children's Research Hospital
- Children's Oncology Group
- Alex's Lemonade Stand Foundation
- Cure Childhood Cancer Foundation

**Allocation Logic:**
- 70% to treatment and research
- 20% to family support services
- 10% to emerging therapeutic approaches

### Secondary: Technology Access for Underserved Communities

**Why technology access?**

Because this system was built on borrowed Wi-Fi, scraped-together hardware, and the internet's open knowledge. Everyone deserves that chance.

**Specific Organizations:**
- Code.org
- Black Girls Code
- /dev/color
- Digital Harbor Foundation

## Why This Matters

### The Broke Tinkerer's Promise

When you build something from **negative $32.67**, you remember what it's like to have nothing. You remember:
- Not being able to afford medication
- Watching loved ones suffer because you can't help
- Being locked out of opportunities because you don't have money
- Feeling powerless against a system that doesn't care

**This 7% is the insurance that this system will never forget where it came from.**

### The Math of Giving

Most companies give 1-2% to charity. Some give nothing. We give **7%** because:

1. **We can afford it** - If you're profitable at 7% less, you're sustainable
2. **It's material** - 7% actually makes a difference
3. **It's painful** - It should hurt a little, or it doesn't matter
4. **It's permanent** - Smart contracts don't have amnesia

### The Incentive Alignment

By locking this in **before** the money comes:
- We prove it's not about the money
- We align long-term value with social good
- We attract contributors who care
- We repel grifters who don't

## How to Verify

Anyone can verify the charity lock at any time:

### 1. Check Smart Contract
```bash
# View contract source on Etherscan
https://etherscan.io/address/0x.../code

# Query charity percentage
cast call $CONTRACT "CHARITY_PERCENTAGE()" --rpc-url $RPC

# Verify immutability
cast call $CONTRACT "verifyCharityLock()" --rpc-url $RPC
```

### 2. Track Distributions
```bash
# Get total distributed
cast call $CONTRACT "totalCharityDistributed()" --rpc-url $RPC

# Get specific distribution
cast call $CONTRACT "getDistribution(uint256)" 0 --rpc-url $RPC
```

### 3. Monitor Real-Time
```bash
# Subscribe to events
cast logs --address $CONTRACT --rpc-url $RPC

# View dashboard
curl https://charity.sovereignty.arch/api/stats
```

### 4. Audit Beneficiaries
- St. Jude confirms receipt: https://www.stjude.org/donor-verification
- Tech access charities publish donor lists
- Transaction hashes publicly visible on blockchain

## Community Governance

While the 7% is **immutable**, the community can vote on:
1. **Beneficiary selection** (within primary/secondary categories)
2. **Allocation adjustments** (70/30 split can be modified via DAO vote)
3. **Emergency distributions** (disaster relief, urgent needs)
4. **Reporting frequency** (monthly vs quarterly)

**What the community CANNOT change:**
- The 7% percentage
- The existence of the charity lock
- The smart contract code
- The immutability guarantee

## The Eternal Compact

This is not charity. This is **justice**.

Every line of code in this repository was written by someone who:
- Had nothing
- Was told it was impossible
- Built it anyway
- And now ensures that what was built helps those who have nothing

**7% forever. No exceptions. No backdoors. No compromise.**

*"7% forever. For the kids who can't fight for themselves. For the kids who need a laptop to change their life. For the kids who were us."*

**From negative balance, we locked charity into the foundation of everything we build.**
