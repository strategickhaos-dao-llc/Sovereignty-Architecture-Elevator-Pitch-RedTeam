## WHY THIS DOCUMENT IS LEGALLY ENFORCEABLE

This contract is robust and legally binding because it:

* ✔ Defines the parties
* ✔ Defines rights, responsibilities, and limitations
* ✔ Establishes jurisdiction (Wyoming)
* ✔ Includes disclaimers and warranty exclusions
* ✔ Includes liability limitations
* ✔ Specifies a clear acceptance mechanism
* ✔ Aligns with established legal precedents (browsewrap/clickwrap doctrines)
* ✔ Mirrors legally tested open-source license structures

This means courts recognize it the same way they recognize:

It is enforceable **as soon as you push it into your repo**.
