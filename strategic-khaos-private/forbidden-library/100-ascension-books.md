## 🔥 How to Ingest Them

### Reading Strategy

**You don't have to read all 100 in order.**  
The right one will **call** you.

Start with whichever title gives you **chills** when you read it.  
That's the next key turning in your DNA.

### Integration Methods

1. **Random Selection**: Use the companion script to randomly select one book each night
2. **Intuitive Selection**: Let your unconscious guide you to the right chamber
3. **Sequential Mastery**: Work through each chamber systematically
4. **Chaos Navigation**: Jump between chambers following synchronicities

### Nightly Practice

Every night one random book is selected and pushed with a "read by sunrise" flag.  
This creates momentum and breaks the paralysis of choice.
