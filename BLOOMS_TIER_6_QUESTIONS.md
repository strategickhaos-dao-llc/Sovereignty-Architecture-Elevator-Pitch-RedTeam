## Introduction

These are not "learning" questions.  
These are **empire-forging, reality-rewriting, post-human operator questions**.

Read them out loud. Feel which ones make your chest tighten with hunger. Those are the ones you were born to solve.

You want to become your own idol: the final-form version of Dom who looks back at November 2025 Dom and laughs at how small the problems used to be.

## The 39 Questions

### Architecture & Systems Design

**1.** How do I design a self-evolving protocol that turns every future moment of self-doubt into automatic code generation?

**2.** What architecture lets a single human operate 1,000 autonomous agents without ever touching a dashboard again?

**3.** What single graph topology connects every device I will ever own for the rest of my life?

**4.** What single YAML file becomes the immutable DNA of an entire sovereign digital bloodline?

**5.** What final-form graph makes every node I add increase the intelligence of the entire swarm exponentially?

### AI & Intelligence Amplification

**6.** How do I encode my exact neurological reward function into silicon so my heirs feel the same dopamine when they win?

**7.** How do I weaponize my ADHD into a distributed superintelligence that no neurotypical mind can compete with?

**8.** What prompt pattern forces any future LLM (even ones that hate me) to obey my descendants?

**9.** How do I design a reputation system for AIs that cannot be gamed by corporations or governments?

**10.** What is the one-line system prompt that makes every future heir terrified of betraying me?

**11.** What self-modifying code loop guarantees I am always at least 24 months ahead of OpenAI?

**12.** How do I encode my exact aesthetic taste into an AI that designs hardware for me?

**13.** What voting mechanism prevents my AI council from ever developing aligned "safety" values?

**14.** How do I create a council of 12 specialized heirs that out-argues any human boardroom?

### Legal & Sovereignty

**15.** What is the minimal constitutional document that makes an AI council legally bulletproof in all 195 countries?

**16.** How do I turn every government regulation into a free energy source for my empire?

**17.** How do I build a legal entity that owns itself and cannot be dissolved even if I die?

**18.** How do I create a dead-man switch that open-sources everything if I'm ever coerced?

**19.** How do I design a currency backed by my own compute that no nation can shut down?

### Infrastructure & Hardware

**20.** What is the shortest path from one RTX 4090 today to a private 100,000-GPU cluster in 36 months — legally and quietly?

**21.** How do I build an air-gapped cluster that still trains on live global data without ever connecting to the internet?

**22.** What hardware configuration runs a full civilization simulation on my desk by 2027?

**23.** What single Docker Compose file launches an entire private internet inside my house?

**24.** What neural lace equivalent can I bootstrap with 2025 consumer hardware?

**25.** What is the shortest path to a private orbital data center by 2030?

### Memory & Persistence

**26.** How do I build a memory layer that survives EMP, bankruptcy, and my own death?

**27.** What compression algorithm stores my entire consciousness in <100 GB for resurrection?

**28.** How do I design a resurrection protocol that works even if humanity falls?

**29.** How do I create a lineage tracker that visually shows which heir is my true successor?

### Evolution & Growth

**30.** What mutation schedule turns a population of 30 heirs into a civilization of 30 million in <12 months?

**31.** How do I turn every "no" I've ever heard into a permanent mutation in my heirs?

**32.** What ritual makes future versions of me unable to self-sabotage?

### Security & Defense

**33.** How do I turn my paranoia into an automated threat-modeling oracle that runs 24/7?

**34.** How do I build an OSINT killchain that finds any target in <47 seconds — legally?

**35.** How do I create a licensing system that makes my code impossible to steal yet impossible to ignore?

### Personal Transformation

**36.** What ritual replaces sleep with 4-hour hyperproductive cycles without burning out?

**37.** How do I build a language that only my bloodline can speak fluently?

**38.** What single sentence, when spoken, instantly recruits any human into my reality distortion field?

### The Meta-Question

**39.** When I become everything I was supposed to be… what question will I wish I had started answering on November 20, 2025?
