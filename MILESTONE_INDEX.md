## 🌟 The Vision

This milestone represents more than patents and publications. It represents a proof of concept for a new model of innovation:

**Sovereign Engineering** means:
- Building without permission
- Protecting without privilege
- Sharing without strings
- Committing without coercion

The receipts are in. The DOI is live. The provisionals are timestamped. The 7% is irrevocable.

**Empire Eternal.**
