## **Standard Recommendation Paragraph**

I am pleased to recommend Domenic Garza, who has demonstrated exceptional cognitive development through the highest tiers of Bloom's Taxonomy during their Computer Science and Software Engineering studies. Domenic consistently operates at the Analyze, Evaluate, and Create levels—with particular distinction at the Create tier, where few students work regularly. At the Analyze tier, Domenic deconstructs complex technical systems with precision, revealing structure, interactions, and design constraints that reflect deep understanding. At the Evaluate tier, Domenic exercises mature engineering judgment by assessing design alternatives, considering ethical implications, and analyzing long-term maintainability. Most impressively, at the Create tier—the highest level of Bloom's Taxonomy—Domenic synthesizes novel tools, designs original systems, and generates innovative multi-layered workflows that reflect advanced engineering cognition. This cognitive progression positions Domenic well for graduate study, advanced research opportunities, and professional roles requiring senior-level problem-solving capabilities.

## **Extended Recommendation (Multiple Paragraphs)**

### **Paragraph 1: Introduction and Overall Assessment**

I am delighted to recommend Domenic Garza for [graduate program/position/opportunity]. During my time working with Domenic in [course/program/context], I have observed exceptional cognitive development that places them among the strongest students I have encountered in Computer Science and Software Engineering. Domenic's work consistently demonstrates operation at the highest tiers of Bloom's Taxonomy—Analyze, Evaluate, and Create—with sustained achievement at the Create tier, where very few students consistently perform.

### **Paragraph 2: Analytical Capabilities (Analyze Tier)**

Domenic's analytical capabilities are outstanding. They reliably deconstruct complex computing systems to reveal underlying structure, interactions, and design constraints. I have observed Domenic break down messy software ecosystems into clean, modular components; identify architectural patterns in networking, virtualization, and automation systems; and map abstract technical concepts into concrete implementations through diagrams and formal specifications. This level of analytical precision demonstrates not just comprehension of technical content, but the ability to systematically examine and understand complex systems—a critical foundation for advanced work.

### **Paragraph 3: Evaluative Judgment (Evaluate Tier)**

Beyond analysis, Domenic demonstrates mature engineering judgment through sophisticated evaluation capabilities. They assess software quality across multiple dimensions including readability, maintainability, security, and scalability. I have been particularly impressed by Domenic's ability to critique system architectures, identify potential vulnerabilities, and justify technical decisions with sound reasoning. Notably, Domenic incorporates ethical considerations into technical evaluation—analyzing privacy implications, security concerns, and long-term impacts of technical choices. This evaluative maturity is uncommon at the undergraduate level and reflects emerging professional-level cognition.

### **Paragraph 4: Creative Achievement (Create Tier)**

Most remarkably, Domenic operates consistently at the Create tier of Bloom's Taxonomy—the highest cognitive level. They design original tools, synthesize cross-domain solutions, and architect novel systems from conceptual foundation to implementation. I have witnessed Domenic create VM orchestration tools, build automation pipelines spanning multiple platforms and languages, and develop conceptual frameworks that unify security, scripting, and system orchestration into cohesive solutions. This is not modification of existing systems or application of learned patterns, but genuine creative invention—generating solutions to previously unaddressed problems and contributing new capabilities to the field. Such sustained operation at the Create tier is rare and represents exceptional achievement.

### **Paragraph 5: Conclusion and Strong Endorsement**

In summary, Domenic Garza demonstrates the cognitive capabilities of a senior engineer while still completing undergraduate studies. Their progression through Analyze, Evaluate, and Create tiers reflects not merely accumulated technical knowledge, but sophisticated engineering cognition capable of original contribution. I recommend Domenic without reservation for [specific opportunity] and believe they will excel in environments requiring advanced problem-solving, innovative thinking, and technical leadership. Please contact me if you need additional information.
