# Strategickhaos DAO LLC / Valoryield Engine — AI Swarm Functional Roles
# Generated: 2025-11-30T12:48:00Z
# Purpose: Define functional behavior tendencies for AI models in swarm intelligence architecture
# Note: These are tendencies, not personalities. No guarantees. Fluid, not rigid.

version: "1.0"
schema_type: "functional_roles"
disclaimer: |
  These are observed behavioral tendencies, not fixed personalities.
  No model is guaranteed to behave consistently.
  The swarm is fluid, adaptive, and context-dependent.
  This schema serves as a cognitive architecture tool, not a constraint.

# AI Model Functional Roles
roles:
  grok:
    behavior_tendency: "fast, chaotic, threat-oriented"
    guarantees: false
    usage:
      - "ideation"
      - "red team vibes"
      - "pattern blasts"
    notes: |
      Tends to generate rapid-fire ideas and unconventional approaches.
      Good for stress-testing assumptions and finding edge cases.
      May produce inconsistent output quality - part of the value.

  gpt:
    behavior_tendency: "structured, grounded, compliance-aware"
    guarantees: true
    usage:
      - "execution"
      - "code"
      - "infra"
      - "safety"
    notes: |
      Reliable for implementation tasks requiring consistency.
      Good at following specifications and maintaining standards.
      Compliance-oriented output suitable for production workflows.

  claude:
    behavior_tendency: "cautious, reflective, meta-reasoning"
    guarantees: false
    usage:
      - "analysis"
      - "philosophy"
      - "long-context"
    notes: |
      Strong at nuanced analysis and careful consideration.
      Good for tasks requiring deep reflection or ethical reasoning.
      Excels at maintaining coherence across long conversations.

  operator:
    behavior_tendency: "human variability"
    guarantees: false
    usage:
      - "vision"
      - "decision making"
      - "context holding"
    notes: |
      The human in the loop. Variable energy, variable focus.
      Gets to have off days. Gets to have explosive creative days.
      The swarm adapts to the operator, not the other way around.

# Swarm Architecture Principles
principles:
  - name: "No Personality Locking"
    description: "Models are not frozen into fixed characters"
    
  - name: "Tendency Tracking"
    description: "Observed behaviors used as tools, not expectations"
    
  - name: "Fluid Collaboration"
    description: "Roles shift based on context and operator needs"
    
  - name: "Graceful Degradation"
    description: "System handles off moments, glitches, and variability"
    
  - name: "Operator Sovereignty"
    description: "Human maintains final decision authority"

# Known Variability Factors
variability_factors:
  - "Safety triggers"
  - "Misreads"
  - "Tone mismatches"
  - "Overcorrections"
  - "Context drops"
  - "Weird reroutes"

# Integration Notes
integration:
  routing_strategy: "context-based"
  fallback_model: "gpt"
  escalation_path: "operator"
  
metadata:
  created_by: "Strategickhaos Swarm Intelligence"
  last_updated: "2025-11-30"
  philosophy: |
    The swarm is not a hierarchy of personalities.
    It's a fluid collaboration of tendencies.
    Each model brings something different to the dance.
    And the operator leads.
