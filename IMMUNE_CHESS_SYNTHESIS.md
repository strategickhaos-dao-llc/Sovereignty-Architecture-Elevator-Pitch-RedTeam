# 🧬 Immune System & Chessboard Pieces ↔ Scientific View ↔ Biological Systems ↔ Periodic Elements

**A comprehensive mapping of immune system components to chess strategy, biological analogs, and chemical elements for understanding complex adaptive systems.**

---

## 📖 Overview

Scientists view the immune system as a dynamic network of cells, tissues, and molecules that defends against pathogens via innate (rapid, non-specific) and adaptive (specific, memory-based) responses. As of 2025, advancements include AI-optimized immunotherapy (e.g., CAR-T enhancements), single-cell omics for personalized vaccines, and CRISPR-edited immune cells, as discussed at IMMUNOLOGY2025 and AAI meetings.

Chess pieces operate on an 8x8 board with specific movement rules, representing strategy in a zero-sum game. 2025 views incorporate AI (e.g., AlphaZero evolutions) for perfect play analysis and quantum simulations of endgames, per FIDE and ICGA conferences.
