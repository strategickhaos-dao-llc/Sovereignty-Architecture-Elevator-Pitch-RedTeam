# 🏛️ SOVEREIGN CONSTITUTION OF STRATEGICKHAOS
## Version 1.0 | Ratio Ex Nihilo

---

**Preamble**

We, the architects of Strategickhaos, in order to form a sovereign digital infrastructure, establish operational excellence, ensure systemic resilience, provide for adaptive evolution, promote accelerated growth, and secure the blessings of autonomous creation to ourselves and our posterity, do ordain and establish this Constitution for the Strategickhaos Sovereign Architecture.
