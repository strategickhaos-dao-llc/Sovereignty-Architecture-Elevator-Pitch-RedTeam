## The Dual-Yield Architecture

All monetization from the Strategickhaos ecosystem (royalties, licensing fees, enterprise seats, model sales, bounties, merchandise, etc.) automatically splits into two parallel revenue streams:

### 1. ValorYield (7% - The Sacred Heartbeat)

**Allocation**: 7% of all gross revenues  
**Status**: IRREVOCABLE, ON-CHAIN, ETERNAL  
**Purpose**: 100% external charitable contributions  

**Beneficiary Distribution**:
- **40%** → St. Jude Children's Research Hospital
- **40%** → Médecins Sans Frontières (Doctors Without Borders)
- **20%** → Veterans support organizations (rotating/selected)

**Enforcement Mechanisms**:
- Multi-signature smart contracts on Solana/Ethereum
- DAO bylaws codification
- IRS 501(c)(3) compliance filings
- Public blockchain transparency
- Quarterly audited distributions

**The Promise**: This is the "kids with cancer" commitment. Untouchable. Eternal. Public accountability.
