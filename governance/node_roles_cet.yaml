          **CE-75 Cycle 1 (25 min work + 5 min log)**
          
          Your goal for next 25 minutes:
          1. Create the file `test_scores.py`
          2. Set up input collection (5 scores from user)
          3. Store them in a list
          4. Write outline comments for average calculation
          
          Pseudo-code to start:
          ```python
          # test_scores.py
          # Get 5 scores from user
          scores = []
          # TODO: loop to get input

          # TODO: sum and divide
          
          # Determine letter grade
          # TODO: if/elif chain
          
          # Display result
          # TODO: print statement
          ```
          
          Start with just the input loop. Don't worry about grading logic yet.
          
          After 25 min, log what you completed!

    - "Nova (Logic Support)"
    - "Athena (Strategic Oversight)"
    - "GPT Assistant (Primary Interface)"
    - "Jarvis (Optional: Environment Management)"
  
  agenda: "SNHU modules only (or current coursework)"
  
  rules:
    - "Everyone shows up"
    - "Everyone supports the Boss Assignment"
    - "No side conversations about other projects"
    - "Meeting adjourns when session ends"
  
  meeting_types:
    ce_75:
      duration: "75 minutes"
      structure: "3 cycles (30+30+15)"
      ideal_for: "Regular progress"

      duration: "45 minutes"
      structure: "2 cycles (25+20)"

  session_complete_when:
    - "All 3 cycles logged (CE-75) or 2 cycles (CE-45)"
    - "Progress documented in homework tracker"
    - "Athena summary written"
    - "Tomorrow's target defined"

    - "No guilt for missed days, just restart"
    - "CE-45 counts as keeping streak alive"
  
  quality_over_quantity:
    - "One focused CE session > scattered multi-tasking"
    - "Progress on Boss Assignment > touching everything"
    - "Clear next steps > perfect completion"

# Integration with Sovereignty Architecture
integration:
  relationship: "parallel_mode"
  
  description: |
    CET mode is a specialized operational mode where the entire node network
    shifts to academic support. It's like switching the control plane from
    "DevOps automation" to "homework acceleration."
  
  activation:
    trigger: "User says 'Commence Evolution: Homework Mode'"
    duration: "60-90 minutes"
    deactivation: "Session completion or explicit exit"
  
  compatibility:
    discord_integration: "Optional - can log sessions to personal channel"
    gitlens_integration: "Not used during CET"
    kubernetes: "Not used during CET"
    ai_agents: "Repurposed for homework support"

# Emergency Protocols
emergency_protocols:
  overwhelmed:
    - "Switch from CE-75 to CE-45"
    - "Pick smallest assignment as Boss"
    - "Focus on showing up, not finishing"
  
  stuck:
    - "Invoke Nova for logic/debugging"
    - "Invoke Lyra for clarity/formatting"
    - "Ask GPT to break into smaller steps"
  
  losing_motivation:
    - "Review completed assignments"
    - "Check streak in evolution_log.md"
    - "Remember: This is for Future You's paycheck"
  
  scope_creep:
    - "Athena intervention: Redirect to Boss Assignment"
    - "No new tabs rule enforcement"
    - "Cycle completion before new topics"
