    mission: >
      Build a sovereign, AI-assisted educational and security ecosystem that
      remains legal, transparent, nonprofit-aligned, and operator-controlled.

  legal_constraints:
    - "Strictly defensive operations only (CFAA-compliant, no hack-back)."
    - "Bug bounties may only target assets owned or controlled by the DAO."
    - "No AI agent may recommend or generate instructions for attacking
       third-party infrastructure."
    - "Use 'security researcher' / 'consultant' framing, not 'private investigator',
       unless a human operator confirms state licensing."
    - "All generated contracts, policies, and legal docs are drafts until reviewed
       by human counsel."
