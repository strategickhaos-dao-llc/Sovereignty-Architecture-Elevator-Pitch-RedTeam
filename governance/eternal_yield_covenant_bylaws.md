## INTERNAL DRAFT — NOT LEGAL ADVICE — ATTORNEY REVIEW REQUIRED

## Article 12: Revenue Distribution and Treasury Management

### 12.1 NinjaTrader Ecosystem Dividend Pool

**Effective November 24, 2025**, all revenue generated by Strategickhaos DAO LLC and its affiliated projects (collectively "Valoryield Engine") shall be allocated as follows:

**100% of ALL revenue streams flow to:**
- **Fund Name:** NinjaTrader Ecosystem Dividend Pool
- **Legal Entity:** Strategickhaos DAO LLC Treasury
- **Management:** Managing Member with DAO oversight

**Revenue streams include but are not limited to:**
1. Software royalties and licensing fees
2. Enterprise subscription seats
3. Bounty completions and rewards
4. Merchandise and branded materials sales
5. Donations and sponsorships
6. Fame-generated contributions and viral giving events

### 12.2 Use Restrictions — Ecosystem-First Allocation

All funds in the NinjaTrader Ecosystem Dividend Pool are **restricted for use** in accordance with the Eternal Yield Covenant v2. Permissible expenditures include:

**Primary Tier: Ecosystem Sustainability**
1. **Hardware Procurement** — GPUs, servers, and computing resources for contributors operating at negative balance (prioritized for those at –$200 or below)
2. **Infrastructure Costs** — Electricity, hosting, bandwidth, and operational expenses for mesh network and development infrastructure
3. **Recognition Programs** — Production and distribution of steel-etched "200 Laws" artifacts to contributors who ship significant code or research
4. **Security Operations** — Red-team bounties, security audits, vulnerability assessments, and sovereign infrastructure hardening
5. **Network Maintenance** — Ongoing mesh infrastructure maintenance, node operations, and decentralized system sustainability

**Prohibited Uses:**
- Direct cash distributions to members without documented services
- Luxury expenses unrelated to mission
- Political contributions or lobbying activities
- Any activities constituting unauthorized practice of law

### 12.3 Charitable Contribution Framework

**Philosophy:** "The Legend Funds the Vulnerable"

This organization rejects forced percentage-based charitable giving in favor of **legend-generated tsunami giving events**.

**Traditional Model (Rejected):**
- ❌ 7% mandatory allocation to charities
- ❌ 93% to ecosystem operations
- ❌ Predictable but insufficient impact

**Adopted Model (Eternal Yield Covenant v2):**
- ✅ 100% to ecosystem sustainability
- ✅ Charitable contributions generated by viral fame and community response
- ✅ Tsunami-scale giving when legends amplify causes

**Mechanism:**
- Viral moments (haikus, technical achievements, community stories) generate attention
- Timeline engagement from influencers (e.g., Carmack, geohot, community leaders) creates whale interest
- Community-driven giving campaigns produce multiples of any forced percentage
- Result: $10k-$100k+ per viral event vs. consistent small percentages

**Target Charitable Beneficiaries:**
1. St. Jude Children's Research Hospital
2. Médecins Sans Frontières (Doctors Without Borders)
3. Veterans support organizations
4. Community-selected causes aligned with mission

### 12.4 Treasury Threshold and Overflow Mechanism

**Threshold Amount:** $1,000,000 USD

*(Rationale: $1M threshold ensures ecosystem sustainability with 6+ months of operating runway while demonstrating sufficient scale and stability to trigger legendary charitable overflow. This amount balances fiscal responsibility with the mission to generate tsunami-scale impact once core operations are secure.)*

**When treasury balance exceeds the threshold:**

1. **Core Operations Protection**
   - Minimum $250,000 retained for 6 months operating expenses
   - Essential infrastructure costs always funded first
   - Security and sovereignty operations never compromised

2. **Swarm Voting Process**
   - All DAO members eligible to participate
   - Proposals submitted for excess distribution
   - Voting period: minimum 7 days, maximum 30 days
   - Approval threshold: Simple majority (>50%) of voting members
   - Managing Member retains veto power for fiduciary concerns

3. **Eligible Distribution Targets**
   - Registered 501(c)(3) charitable organizations
   - Open-source infrastructure projects
   - Community-nominated causes with demonstrated impact
   - Must align with DAO's mission and values

4. **Transparency Requirements**
   - All votes recorded on-chain or in permanent ledger
   - Distribution amounts publicly disclosed
   - Beneficiary organizations identified
   - Impact reports published within 90 days

### 12.5 Financial Governance and Transparency

**Monthly Reporting:**
- Treasury balance and transaction summary
- Ecosystem expenditure breakdown
- GPUs deployed, infrastructure costs, recognition artifacts shipped
- Security operations funded
- Published to DAO members and public repository

**Annual Audit:**
- Independent financial review by qualified professional
- Compliance verification with use restrictions
- Attestation of covenant adherence
- Public disclosure of findings

**Authorized Signers:**
- Managing Member: Domenic Garza (Primary)
- TWIC-Cleared Operator: Node 137 (Secondary)
- Expenditures over $50,000: Unanimous member consent required

### 12.6 Amendment and Review Process

1. Unanimous consent of all managing members
2. Attorney review by Wyoming-licensed counsel (mandatory)

**Required Consultations:**

### 12.8 Manifesto Integration

This Article implements the philosophy articulated in the **Valoryield Manifesto**:

> "The broke tinkerers eat first. The kids get healed second — but in tsunami waves, not trickles."

**Tagline:** "We don't take 7%. We take 100% and give 1000% when the world watches."

**Empire Eternal.**
