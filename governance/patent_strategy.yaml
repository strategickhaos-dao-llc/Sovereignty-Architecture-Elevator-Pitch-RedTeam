# USPTO Background Section Template
uspto_background_template: |
  Analysis of 100+ sources on defensive publication failures, GitHub Spark 
  development risks, and multi-agent AI governance (2025) identified critical 
  failure modes including:
  - 15% YAML merge incompleteness in prior art challenges
  - 25% patent forfeiture from over-publication  
  - 30% AI-generated code hallucinations in multi-agent systems
  - 82% inter-agent vulnerability exploitation risks

  The present invention addresses these failure modes through novel YAML-based 
  governance with cryptographic verification, multi-agent policy conflict 
  resolution, and defensive publication sequencing that preserves patent 
  priority while enabling strategic disclosure.

# Filing sequence
filing_sequence:
  step_1:
    action: "File Provisional Patent"
    timing: "Immediate"
    outcome: "Locks priority date, keeps options open"
    deliverable: "USPTO 63/XXXXXX number"
    
  step_2:
    action: "Selective Defensive Publication"
    timing: "After provisional filing"
    outcome: "Public disclosure without claim forfeiture"
    constraint: "Only non-patentable content"
    
  step_3:
    action: "YAML Governance Enforcement"
    timing: "Ongoing"
    outcome: "Prevents agent policy drift"
    enforcement: "automated_ci_checks"
