### B. Bug Bounty Program via LLC Self-Hire Structure

The Board discussed a legal structure wherein StrategicKhaos DAO LLC contracts the Operator as an independent contractor for threat hunting, adversary research, and bug bounty coordination services.

**Key Elements**:

- LLC invoices Operator for:
  - Threat hunting & adversary research services
  - Red-team simulation and exploit documentation
  - Bug-bounty coordination and responsible disclosure
- Program deployed via Bugcrowd/HackerOne/Intigriti with proper safe-harbor language
- Scope limited to defensive, legal countermeasures per CFAA compliance
- Payout tiers structured: Stripe USD + experimental XMR options

**Legal Opinion**: Self-hire via LLC is common for solopreneurs (1099 contractor model). Texas TDLR PI licensing requirements noted for investigation services.
