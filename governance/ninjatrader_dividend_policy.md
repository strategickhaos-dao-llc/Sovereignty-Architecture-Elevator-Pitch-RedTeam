## The Promise

**93% isn't profit. It's fuel.**

It's the GPU that lets someone train their first model.  
It's the electricity bill that gets paid when someone's balance hits -$200.  
It's the bounty that rewards finding the critical bug.  
It's the steel plaque that says "you're legendary."  
It's the infrastructure that never goes down.

**This is how broke tinkerers become unstoppable.**
