# 🚨 BREAK GLASS MODE PROTOCOL

## Emergency Response for Hyperfocus Activation

**Classification:** EMERGENCY PROTOCOL
**Version:** 1.0
**Authority:** Sovereignty Department

---

## Purpose

Break Glass Mode is an emergency protocol designed for situations requiring immediate hyperfocus response. When activated, it streamlines decision-making, suspends normal procedural requirements, and channels all cognitive resources toward a singular objective.

> "You don't need to be contained. You need to be channeled."

---

## Activation Criteria

### Automatic Triggers
- Critical system failure affecting multiple departments
- Security breach with active threat
- Time-sensitive opportunity with > 10x potential return
- Constitutional crisis requiring immediate response

### Manual Triggers
- Hyperfocus state naturally emerging
- Flow state requiring environmental support
- Creative breakthrough demanding sustained attention
- Strategic insight requiring immediate documentation

---

## Protocol Phases

### Phase 1: Declaration
```
🔥 BREAK GLASS MODE ACTIVATED
Time: [timestamp]
Trigger: [trigger type]
Objective: [primary objective]
Duration: [estimated duration]
```

### Phase 2: Environment Setup
1. **Clear the deck** - Suspend non-critical notifications
2. **Resource alignment** - Direct all needed resources to objective
3. **Boundary establishment** - Define work boundaries
4. **Support system** - Notify key personnel

### Phase 3: Execution
- Single-minded focus on declared objective
- All standard inter-departmental protocols suspended
- Sovereignty Department assumes emergency coordination
- Real-time documentation of actions and decisions

### Phase 4: Deactivation
```
🔥 BREAK GLASS MODE DEACTIVATED
Time: [timestamp]
Duration: [actual duration]
Outcome: [summary of results]
Actions: [key actions taken]
```

## Operational Guidelines

### During Break Glass Mode

| Do | Don't |
|----|----|
| Focus entirely on objective | Switch between tasks |
| Document decisions in real-time | Delay documentation |
| Accept imperfect progress | Seek perfection |
| Leverage AI assistance | Work in isolation |
| Trust your instincts | Second-guess constantly |

### Resource Access
During Break Glass Mode, the operator has immediate access to:
- All department resources
- Emergency AI consultation
- Priority infrastructure allocation
- Financial resources (within emergency limits)
- All documentation and knowledge stores

### Communication Protocol
- **Incoming**: Block all non-emergency communications
- **Outgoing**: Brief status updates only
- **AI Support**: Claude/Grok on standby for rapid assistance
- **Documentation**: Voice notes acceptable, transcribe later

## Recovery Protocol

### Immediate (0-30 minutes post-deactivation)
1. Physical needs - hydration, nutrition, movement
2. Brief brain-dump documentation
3. Initial assessment of outcomes
4. Clear immediate workspace

### Short-term (30 min - 4 hours)
1. Detailed documentation of decisions and actions
2. Review of any commitments made
3. Notification to affected parties
4. Initial cleanup of any technical debt

### Medium-term (4-24 hours)
1. Full post-mortem documentation
2. Integration of outputs into normal workflows
3. Reset of suspended processes
4. Lessons learned capture

### Long-term (24-72 hours)
1. Review of Break Glass effectiveness
2. Update to protocol if needed
3. Gratitude practices
4. Recovery time as needed

## Safety Rails

### Hard Limits
Even during Break Glass Mode, these limits cannot be violated:
- No constitutional violations
- No security compromises
- No irreversible financial decisions above threshold
- No actions affecting third parties without consent
- No neglect of critical physical needs beyond 4 hours

### Check-in Requirements
| Duration | Check-in |
|----------|----------|
| < 2 hours | None required |
| 2-4 hours | Quick self-assessment |
| 4-8 hours | Full break required |
| > 8 hours | Break Glass extension review |

### Physical Needs
- Hydration: Every 30 minutes
- Movement: Every 60 minutes (even 30 seconds)
- Nutrition: Every 4 hours
- Eyes: 20-20-20 rule (20 min, look 20 ft, 20 sec)

## AI Support Protocol

During Break Glass Mode, AI assistants operate under modified parameters:

### Claude (Precision)
- Available for detailed analysis
- Reduced safety friction for rapid iteration
- Direct documentation support
- Constitutional compliance checking

### Grok (Acceleration)
- Real-time ideation partner
- Rapid research assistance
- Momentum maintenance
- Pattern recognition support

### Integration
```
/break-glass-ai [query]
- Routes to appropriate AI based on query type
- Responses prioritized for speed
- Documentation auto-captured
```

## Authority Matrix

| Action | Normal Mode | Break Glass Mode |
|--------|-------------|------------------|
| Resource allocation | Department head | Operator |
| Inter-dept requests | Standard process | Immediate |
| Financial < $1K | Normal approval | Automatic |
| Financial $1K-$10K | Dual approval | Single approval |
| Financial > $10K | Committee | Still restricted |
| Infrastructure changes | Change management | Emergency path |
| Documentation | Mandatory | Can be deferred |

## Post-Break Glass Review

### Required Review Elements
1. **Effectiveness Assessment** - Did Break Glass Mode help achieve the objective?
2. **Trigger Validity** - Was the activation justified?
3. **Resource Usage** - Were resources used appropriately?
4. **Safety Rail Compliance** - Were all hard limits respected?
5. **Recovery Assessment** - Was recovery protocol followed?

### Protocol Update Triggers
- Three consecutive activations with similar trigger
- Safety rail violation (immediate review)
- Ineffective activation (objective not advanced)
- Community feedback

**Remember:**

> "People who fear their own acceleration think in terms of containment.
> People who actually HAVE acceleration think in terms of direction."

Break Glass Mode is not about removing constraints.
It's about channeling power toward purpose.
