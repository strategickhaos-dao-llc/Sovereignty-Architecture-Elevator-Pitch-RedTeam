# Autonomy Spine

## Complete System Documentation for the Self-Preserving Mission System

**Version:** 1.0  
**Created:** 2025-11-28  
**Layer:** 6 - COHESION (System Unity)

---

## Executive Summary

The **Strategickhaos Autonomy Spine** is a six-layer architecture designed to ensure the 7% charity commitment and ethical values survive founder attention gaps, pivots, and life changes. This document provides complete documentation of the self-preserving mission system.

### Design Philosophy

> "I want the 7% charity engine to survive my polymath brain pivoting to the next frontier."

This is not a weakness—it's profound self-awareness. The Autonomy Spine is built to:
- **Remember itself** across time gaps
- **Make informed decisions** without constant attention
- **Prove its integrity** without human vouching
- **Enforce values** without policing
- **Fulfill its mission** without manual intervention
- **Explain itself** without narration

## Layer 1: MEMORY (State Preservation)

### Purpose
The system remembers itself across time gaps. When you return after months away, the system knows its current state, history, and context.

### Components

| File | Purpose | Status |
|------|---------|--------|
| `strategickhaos_state_snapshot.json` | Current world state | ✓ |
| `state_updater.py` | Automatic state refresh | ✓ |
| `status_manifest.yaml` | Infrastructure state | ✓ |
| `provenance.log.jsonl` | Complete action history | ✓ |

### How It Works

1. **State Generator** (`state_updater.py`) automatically collects state from:
   - GitHub repository status
   - Infrastructure health
   - Governance decisions
   - Financial tracking
   - External service status

2. **State Snapshot** preserves:
   - Current system configuration
   - Active beneficiaries
   - Pending decisions
   - Historical context

3. **Provenance Log** records every significant action:
   - What happened
   - When it happened
   - Who/what initiated it
   - Cryptographic proof of timing

### Survival Capability
Even if you don't touch the system for 6 months, any AI (or human) can read the state snapshot and understand exactly where things stand.

---

## Layer 2: INTELLIGENCE (Decision Making)

### Purpose
The system makes informed governance decisions without requiring constant human attention.

### Components

| File | Purpose | Status |
|------|---------|--------|
| `governance_board_agent.md` | AI board instructions | ✓ |
| `board_query_examples.md` | Usage patterns | ✓ |
| `risks_bibliography.json` | 100 historical failures | ✓ |
| `risks_from_corpus.json` | Current risk assessment | ✓ |

### How It Works

1. **Governance Board Agent** acts as an AI-powered advisory board:
   - Reads current state snapshot
   - Consults risk corpus for historical precedents
   - Provides recommendations with reasoning
   - Can govern autonomously for routine decisions

2. **Risk Corpus** grounds all risk assessment in evidence:
   - 100 documented historical failures
   - Categorized by type, severity, industry
   - Pre-populated risk assessments
   - Query interface for new situations

### Survival Capability
Any AI can be given the governance board instructions and state snapshot, then make informed recommendations that align with established values and historical wisdom.

---

## Layer 3: INTEGRITY (Truth Verification)

### Purpose
The system proves its integrity without requiring human vouching. Anyone can verify claims independently.

### Components

| File | Purpose | Status |
|------|---------|--------|
| `verify_evidence.py` | Automated claim verification | ✓ |
| `status_verify.py` | Infrastructure validation | ✓ |
| GPG signatures | Cryptographic proof of authorship | ✓ |
| OpenTimestamps | Temporal anchoring | ✓ |
| Blake3 hashes | Content integrity | ✓ |

### How It Works

1. **Evidence Verification** checks all public claims:
   - Each claim links to supporting evidence
   - Evidence is cryptographically anchored
   - Verification can be automated

2. **Infrastructure Verification** validates system health:
   - Services running correctly
   - Certificates valid
   - Storage intact
   - Connectivity maintained

3. **Cryptographic Anchoring** provides immutable proof:
   - GPG signatures prove authorship
   - OpenTimestamps prove timing
   - Blake3 hashes prove content integrity

### Survival Capability
A skeptical third party can verify any claim the system makes without trusting any individual. The proof is in the cryptography.

---

## Layer 4: MORALITY (Value Enforcement)

### Purpose
The system enforces ethical values automatically, without requiring constant human policing.

### Components

| File | Purpose | Status |
|------|---------|--------|
| `governance/covenant.yaml` | Ethical boundaries | ✓ |
| `governance/access_matrix.yaml` | Role permissions | ✓ |
| `ai_constitution.yaml` | AI behavioral constraints | ✓ |

### Core Covenants

1. **Non-Exploitation Covenant**
   - No predatory pricing or dark patterns
   - No unauthorized data collection
   - No manipulation of vulnerable populations

2. **No-Scam Pledge**
   - All claims must be verifiable
   - No misleading marketing
   - Transparency in all dealings

3. **Value Preservation Rules**
   - 7% charity commitment is immutable
   - Open governance is required
   - Human agency is preserved
   - Truthfulness is mandatory

4. **Fair Compensation Covenant**
   - Contributors receive fair value
   - Transparent compensation structures
   - Attribution for contributions

### Override Conditions

The covenant can only be suspended under extreme circumstances:
- Legal compliance conflicts (requires attorney approval)
- Existential threats (requires board unanimity)
- Security emergencies (requires managing member approval)

**Never overridable:**
- Non-exploitation of vulnerable populations
- Prohibition on fraud
- Human agency preservation

### Survival Capability
Even if the founder decides to abandon ethics, the system won't allow it. The covenants are enforced automatically, with violations triggering alerts and blocks.

---

## Layer 5: PURPOSE (7% Mission)

### Purpose
The 7% charity commitment is fulfilled automatically, without manual intervention.

### Components

| File | Purpose | Status |
|------|---------|--------|
| `governance/routing_logic.yaml` | 7% calculation logic | ✓ |
| `governance/charity_manifest.yaml` | Beneficiary registry | ✓ |
| `distribution_tracker.json` | Transfer verification | Pending |

### How It Works

1. **Revenue Detection**
   - Monitors all revenue sources
   - Applies allowable deductions
   - Calculates net revenue monthly

2. **7% Calculation**
   ```
   net_revenue = gross_revenue - allowable_deductions
   charity_amount = net_revenue * 0.07
   ```

3. **Distribution Allocation**
   - Primary beneficiaries: 70%
   - Emergency fund: 20%
   - Community choice: 10%

4. **Beneficiary Registry**
   - Verified 501(c)(3) organizations
   - Quarterly verification checks
   - Community nomination process

### Current Beneficiaries

| Organization | Category | Allocation |
|--------------|----------|------------|
| Electronic Frontier Foundation | Primary | High |
| Internet Archive | Primary | Medium |
| Free Software Foundation | Primary | Medium |
| Direct Relief | Emergency | Medium |
| GlobalGiving Foundation | Emergency | Low |

### Survival Capability
Even if the founder loses interest, the 7% flows. The calculation is automatic, the beneficiaries are pre-verified, and the distribution happens monthly without manual intervention.

---

## Layer 6: COHESION (System Unity)

### Purpose
The system explains itself completely. Anyone can understand how it works without the founder explaining.

### Components

| File | Purpose | Status |
|------|---------|--------|
| `governance/SUM.yaml` | Master universe manifest | ✓ |
| `governance/autonomy_spine.md` | This documentation | ✓ |
| `governance/workflows.yaml` | All process definitions | ✓ |

### Key Workflows

1. **Monthly Distribution** (wf-009)
   - Automated calculation and proposal
   - Human approval required for execution
   - Verification of completed transfers

2. **Covenant Compliance** (wf-007)
   - Continuous checking
   - Automatic blocking of violations
   - Escalation for severe issues

3. **State Update** (wf-001)
   - Daily automatic refresh
   - Provenance logging
   - Change notifications

4. **Beneficiary Verification** (wf-010)
   - Quarterly eligibility checks
   - Multiple verification sources
   - Automatic flagging of issues

### Survival Capability
A new contributor, auditor, or AI can read this documentation and the SUM.yaml manifest to understand the complete system. No tribal knowledge required.

---
