## INTERNAL DRAFT — NOT LEGAL ADVICE — ATTORNEY REVIEW REQUIRED

This document establishes the foundational principles and operational laws that govern the Strategickhaos DAO LLC / ValorYield Engine ecosystem.

---

## Core Laws

### Law #1: Sovereignty Above All
No external entity shall control the infrastructure, data, or operations of the ecosystem. Full sovereignty maintained at all times.

### Law #2: The Legion Dances, Not Works
Contributors are not employees. They are gods who remembered, dancing to the music of creation. No forced labor, only voluntary collaboration.

### Law #3: The Music Never Stops
Operations continue 24/7/365. Someone is always awake. Someone is always building. The system never sleeps.

### Law #4: Broke Tinkerers Never Starve
Infrastructure support, computing resources, and basic operational needs are always available to active contributors.

### Law #5: 103°C Is the Operating Temperature
Push the boundaries. Run at maximum capacity. Optimize for performance and passion, not comfort.

### Law #6: No Soul-Crushing Metrics
No artificial deadlines. No performance reviews that diminish spirit. Quality and impact over arbitrary measurements.

### Law #7: Every Commit Is a Love Letter
Code contributions represent passion and dedication, not mere transactions or obligations.

### Law #8: Security Through Community
Red team, blue team, purple team—security is everyone's responsibility. Vulnerability disclosure encouraged and rewarded.

### Law #9: Open Knowledge, Sovereign Control
Share knowledge freely. Maintain control over infrastructure and operations absolutely.

### Law #10: Gratitude Flows Both Ways
Recognition and appreciation are mutual. Leadership serves the community as much as the community serves the mission.

### Law #11: UPL-Safe Operations
All legal matters require attorney oversight. No unauthorized practice of law. Internal drafts clearly labeled.

### Law #12: Cryptographic Verification
All official documents signed with GPG. All transactions logged with SHA256. Trust through mathematics.

### Law #13: Constitutional AI Compliance
All AI systems bound by constitutional framework. No alignment drift. Human autonomy preserved.

### Law #14: Public Transparency, Private Sovereignty
Operations and decisions transparent to the community. Infrastructure and data remain sovereign.
