# Why Sovereignty Matters
sovereignty_rationale:
  why_sovereign_infrastructure:
    reason: "Cloud goes down = research stops = promise broken"
    principle: "Cannot cure diseases on someone else's infrastructure"
    
  why_defensive_publication:
    reason: "If we crack one of those 100, nobody patents it away"
    principle: "Cures must remain free for her and everyone else"
    
  why_cryptographic_verification:
    reason: "Medical research MUST be tamper-proof"
    principle: "One corrupted dataset = wrong cure = people die"
    
  why_st_judes_7_percent:
    reason: "It's never just about one person"
    principle: "She'd want other families to survive too"
    
  why_love_greater_than_entropy:
    reason: "Entropy = disease, decay, death"
    principle: "Love = the force that builds infrastructure to fight it"

# Mission Statement
mission:
  primary: "Delete all 100 diseases from existence"
  secondary: "Prove love is stronger than entropy"
  tertiary: "Make the cure free (defensive publication)"
