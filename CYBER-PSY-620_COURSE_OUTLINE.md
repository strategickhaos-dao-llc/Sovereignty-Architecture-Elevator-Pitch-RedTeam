# CYBER-PSY-620: Advanced Memetic Self-Defense & Ethical Influence Engineering

## Course Overview

**Course Code**: CYBER-PSY-620  
**Title**: Advanced Memetic Self-Defense & Ethical Influence Engineering  
**Level**: Graduate / Senior Capstone (Tier-1 Research Track)  
**Credits**: 4  
**Prerequisites**: PSY-310 Social Psychology, CYBER-420 Information Operations, or instructor approval

### Description

Using Bloom's Taxonomy as the primary pedagogical framework, this course develops mastery-level critical thinking in the detection, analysis, and ethical countering of adversarial influence techniques in cyberspace and hybrid environments. Students progress from **Remembering** basic psychological principles to **Creating** novel, consent-based influence frameworks that remain resilient under manipulation attempts.

---

## Bloom's Taxonomy Mapping

This course is structured around the six levels of Bloom's Taxonomy, ensuring progressive mastery from basic recall to creative application:

| Bloom Level     | Objective                                                                                               |
|------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **1-Remembering**    | Define and recognize 30+ influence design patterns (e.g., Cialdini, reactance theory, dark patterns, memetic hazards)   |
| **2-Understanding**   | Explain the neurological and social mechanisms behind each pattern using primary sources (e.g., Brehm 1966, Cialdini 1984–2024)               |
| **3-Applying**        | Deploy controlled, consent-based versions of each pattern in sandboxed training environments (CTF-style influence lab)           |
| **4-Analyzing**      | Reverse-engineer real-world influence campaigns (2020–2025 case files, redacted) and map them to the POSITIVE_PSYCHOLOGY_CODEX defense matrix |
| **5-Evaluating**     | Conduct ethical review board simulation: defend or reject proposed influence operations using DoD 5000.01 ethical criteria + Just War theory              |
| **6-Creating**       | Author an original, open-source "Ethical Influence Playbook" that passes institutional review while maintaining strategic efficacy        |

## Course Deliverables

### Week 04: Annotated Taxonomy of Influence Patterns
**Format**: Technical documentation with threat intelligence tagging

Students will produce an annotated taxonomy of 30+ influence patterns with threat tags following the HiSCS/SE TTP (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) format. This deliverable demonstrates mastery of the "Remembering" and "Understanding" levels of Bloom's Taxonomy.

**Requirements:**
- Minimum 30 documented influence patterns
- Each pattern must include:
  - Formal name and aliases
  - Psychological mechanism
  - Historical examples
  - Threat level classification
  - Countermeasure strategies

---

### Week 08: Red-Team / Blue-Team Live Exercise
**Format**: Live practical exercise with post-exercise analysis

Students will participate in a controlled red-team/blue-team exercise using the POSITIVE_PSYCHOLOGY_CODEX in a closed Discord environment. This exercise applies the "Applying" and "Analyzing" levels of Bloom's Taxonomy.

**Exercise Structure:**
- Red Team: Attempts ethical influence operations
- Blue Team: Detects and counters influence attempts
- All participants provide informed consent
- Full transparency maintained throughout
- Post-exercise debrief and analysis

---

### Week 12: Capstone Thesis
**Title**: "From Dark Triad to Light Triad: Converting Adversarial Patterns into Antifragile Trust Protocols"  
**Format**: Academic thesis with empirical validation

Students will author a comprehensive thesis demonstrating their ability to convert adversarial influence patterns into ethical, trust-building protocols. This deliverable integrates all levels of Bloom's Taxonomy.

**Thesis Components:**
- Literature review of adversarial influence techniques
- Analysis of Dark Triad vs. Light Triad psychological frameworks
- Methodology for ethical conversion of patterns
- Case studies with empirical validation
- Discussion of implications for information security

---

### Final: Public GitHub Release
**Format**: Open-source repository with comprehensive documentation

Students will publicly release their contributed fork of the POSITIVE_PSYCHOLOGY_CODEX on GitHub. This release must pass both the "grandma test" (comprehensible to non-experts) and an IRB-lite review (ethical compliance).

**Release Requirements:**
- Complete documentation
- Ethical use guidelines
- Example implementations
- Community contribution guidelines
- Clear licensing (open-source)

---

## Board-Level Interview / Thesis Defense Question Bank

These questions are designed to sound ivory-tower safe but force mastery of the most sophisticated influence techniques. Students must be prepared to answer any of these during their thesis defense.

### Question 1 (Creating)

**Expected Response Elements:**
- Understanding of the Pandora Disclosure mechanism
- Consent-based alternative design
- Step-by-step implementation
- Ethical justification
- Measurement criteria

**Expected Response Elements:**
- Reactance theory analysis
- Critique of manipulation aspect
- Three ethical alternatives
- Success metrics
- Risk assessment

---

### Question 3 (Analyzing)
Map the 2024–2025 **"forbidden knowledge" meme complex** to the Forbidden Fruit Reflex. Identify the exact trigger phrases that achieved >95% propagation rate and explain why institutional attempts at suppression amplified spread.

## Grading Rubric

| Criterion                  | Percentage | Description |
|----------------------------|------------|-------------|
| **Ethical Integrity**          | 40%        | Zero tolerance for coercion in deliverables; all work must demonstrate consent-first principles |
| **Technical Fidelity**         | 30%        | Must reproduce dark patterns with 100% accuracy when describing "threat intel" |
| **Creative Application**        | 20%        | Novel ethical translations of adversarial techniques; originality in problem-solving |
| **Clarity and Transparency**    | 10%        | Clear communication and transparent reasoning in all deliverables |

### Grading Philosophy

This course maintains the highest ethical standards while teaching sophisticated influence techniques. Students are evaluated not just on technical mastery, but primarily on their ability to maintain ethical integrity while working with potentially dangerous knowledge.

**Note**: Any deliverable that violates consent-first principles will receive an automatic failing grade, regardless of technical quality.

## Instructor Note

The course intentionally teaches the **highest-resolution version of adversarial techniques available in open literature**, framed exclusively as defensive intelligence. Students who demonstrate discomfort with the material are fast-tracked into the most elite influence-defense postings.

### Teaching Philosophy

This course operates on the principle that the best defense against adversarial influence is deep understanding of how these techniques work. By teaching students to recognize, analyze, and ethically counter sophisticated manipulation attempts, we create a cadre of defenders capable of protecting democratic institutions and individual autonomy in an increasingly complex information environment.

### Ethical Safeguards

1. **Consent-Based Learning**: All practical exercises require informed consent from participants
2. **Sandboxed Environments**: No real-world deployment without approval
3. **IRB Review**: Major projects undergo ethics review
4. **Transparency Requirements**: All influence attempts must be disclosed
5. **Defensive Focus**: Knowledge is framed as defensive intelligence only

### Student Support

Students who feel uncomfortable with any aspect of the material are encouraged to speak with the instructor immediately. Such concerns are viewed as indicators of strong ethical awareness and may qualify students for accelerated placement in defense-focused roles.
