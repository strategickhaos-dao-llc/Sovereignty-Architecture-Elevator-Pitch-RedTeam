# Virtuous cycle model
virtuous_cycle:
  description: >
    The Nourish & Build program creates a self-reinforcing positive loop:
    7% of income → food purchases → families fed → community strengthened →
    open-source tools released → developers save money → they donate back →
    more families fed
    
  steps:
    - "SwarmGate allocates 7% from each paycheck"
    - "Half goes to investment (MoneyLion), half to food program"
    - "Food purchases distributed to food banks"
    - "Families receive nutritious meals"
    - "Tax deductions maximize impact"
    - "Sovereignty tools open-sourced"
    - "10K+ developers use free tools"
    - "Economic impact: $30M/year saved collectively"
    - "Grateful developers contribute back"
    - "Cycle continues and grows"
