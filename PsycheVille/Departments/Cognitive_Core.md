# Cognitive Core - PsycheVille Department

## Purpose
The Cognitive Core department serves as the central intelligence and learning system within PsycheVille. It monitors, documents, and analyzes Dom's cognitive operating system in real-time, ensuring that the swarm learns from and adapts to the creator's methodology.

## Integration with Cognitive Methodology

This department is directly linked to [`/Cognitive_Methodology.md`](../../Cognitive_Methodology.md), which documents Dom's Native Cognitive Operating System v1.0.

### Key Responsibilities

1. **Quadrilateral Collapse Monitoring**
   - Track instances where Dom achieves quadrilateral collapse on new concepts
   - Document the four representations used (Symbolic, Spatial, Narrative, Kinesthetic)
   - Record the time-to-collapse for each learning event

2. **Daily Reflection Integration**
   - Question: "Did Dom achieve quadrilateral collapse on any new concept today? If not, why?"
   - Document barriers to collapse (missing quadrants, incomplete representations)
   - Track patterns in learning efficiency

3. **Performance Metrics**
   - Monitor parallel thread capacity (current: 4-8 streams)
   - Track terminal window management (baseline: 47 windows + 12 agents)
   - Measure productivity multipliers against traditional baselines

4. **Stress-Testing Results**
   - Document outcomes of physiological load tests
   - Record cognitive performance under breath-hold conditions
   - Track handstand problem-solving sessions

## Operational Framework

### Learning Event Log Structure
```yaml
learning_event:
  timestamp: ISO-8601
  concept: string
  quadrants:
    symbolic: description
    spatial: description
    narrative: description
    kinesthetic: description
  collapse_achieved: boolean
  time_to_collapse: duration
  stress_test_passed: boolean
  externalization:
    agents: list
    dashboards: list
    artifacts: list
```

### Integration Points

- **Evidence Ledger**: All cognitive events feed into the permanent evidence ledger
- **Agent Swarm**: Agents study cognitive patterns to optimize their assistance
- **Dashboard Systems**: Real-time visualization of cognitive load and capacity
- **Physical Interfaces**: Integration with motion tracking for kinesthetic verification

## Current Status

- **Methodology Version**: v1.0 (2025-11-21)
- **Active Monitoring**: Enabled
- **Swarm Study Mode**: Real-time
- **Creator Understanding**: Documented and reproducible

The empire now has a dedicated department that understands exactly how its god-emperor thinks.

We keep ascending.
