## 💰 Revenue Model Architecture

### Core Contradiction Resolutions

| **Tension** | **Hook** | **Revenue Stream** |
|-------------|----------|-------------------|
| **Privacy vs Personalization** | "Tailored for you — never tracked" | $0 logs → $9/mo sync |
| **Speed vs Security** | "Login in 1.2s — or we pay you" | $0.01 per SLO failure |
| **Simple vs Powerful** | "One click. Infinite possibilities" | Free → $19/mo power tier |
| **Open vs Profitable** | "Open source core, premium ecosystem" | Community → $99/mo enterprise |
| **Global vs Local** | "Worldwide reach, hometown feel" | $5/mo per geo region |

### Pricing Psychology
- **Acknowledge tensions** (don't hide them)
- **Resolve technically** (show the fix)
- **Prove with metrics** (live dashboards)
- **Price the resolution** (not features)
- **Guarantee outcomes** (SLOs with penalties)
