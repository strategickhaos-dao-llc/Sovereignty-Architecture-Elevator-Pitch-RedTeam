        * Efficacy (predicted %)
        * Cost ($)
        * Risk (low/med/high)
        * Timeline (days)
      - Generates master treatment plan

      - Connect you to labs for testing
      - Help navigate FDA compassionate use
      - Track outcomes

      ## Hypothesis
      Mitochondrial dysfunction contributing to chronic fatigue + pain
      
      ## Recommended Stack
      1. CoQ10 (300mg/day) - $30/month
      2. PQQ (20mg/day) - $40/month
      3. Creatine (5g/day) - $15/month
      4. Ketone esters (optional) - $200/month
      
      ## Expected Outcome
      20-40% energy improvement in 4-8 weeks
      
      ## Safety
      All FDA-approved supplements, low risk
      
      ## Next Steps
      1. Start with CoQ10 + PQQ
      2. Add creatine after 2 weeks
      3. Track energy levels daily

      8. Stem cell consult (Law 8): $10K-30K
      
      Total: $25K-45K, higher risk
      
      ## Long-term (6-12 months)
      9. Custom ASO if genetic (Law 9): $200K-500K

      ## Recommended Path
      Start with 1-3 immediately (low risk, low cost)
      If 30% improvement → continue
      If <30% improvement → escalate to 4-6
      Track outcomes rigorously
