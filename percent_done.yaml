# Summary metrics
summary:
  total_items: 36

  # Completion calculations
  # Weighted formula: (real*100 + partial*50 + concept*10) / total_items
  # = (12*100 + 15*50 + 7*10 + 2*0) / 36 = 2020/36 = 56%
  # Conservative estimate (used for greenlight decisions): 51%
  completion_percentage: 51
  
  # Raw count: items at least started (real + partial + concept) / total
  # = (12 + 15 + 7) / 36 = 34/36 = 94%
  raw_percentage: 94
