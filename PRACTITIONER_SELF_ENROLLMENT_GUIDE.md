## Introduction

The USPTO is introducing a new online process of verifying the identity of new patent filers, ID.me, which will be available in addition to mailing notarized paper forms. Using ID.me in coordination with the Patent Center self-enrollment process will allow users to register in less than 30 minutes.

Users can still choose to mail the notarized Patent Electronic Systems Verification form to the Patent Electronic Business Center, which may take up to 10 business days to complete.

## Step 1: Choosing your role

When new users log into Patent Center with a new USPTO.gov account verified with ID.me, they will see a pop-up window to begin the self-enrollment process. Please contact the Patent Electronic Business Center to assist you if the pop-up window does not appear after logging into Patent Center with a new USPTO.gov account verified with ID.me.

After logging into Patent Center, the first step is for users to select their role when accessing the self-enrollment process in Patent Center. There are two roles to choose from, registered patent practitioner and independent (pro-se) inventor.

**Registered Patent Practitioner:** Select this role if you have passed the USPTO's registration exam and met the qualifications to represent patent applicants before the USPTO.

**Independent Inventor:** Select this role if you choose to represent yourself while pursuing ("prosecuting") a patent application.

> **Note:** If independent inventor is selected, please use the Independent Inventor quick start guide for assistance.

### Cancelling Self-enrollment

At any time, you can select "Cancel" to stop self-enrollment. To re-enter the self-enrollment process, click the "Complete self-enrollment" link in the upper right corner of the page. Once self-enrollment is complete, the "Complete self-enrollment" link will no longer be displayed.

## Step 2: Enter your registration/recognition number

Enter the registration/recognition number provided by The Office of Enrollment and Discipline (OED), then select the Continue button.

## Step 3: Validate your registration/recognition number

### Verify that the displayed information is correct

After entering your registration/recognition number, the system will compare the name from the ID.me verification process with the name provided in the OED Registered practitioner portal. If the ID.me verification name matches the OED name, the correspondence/business information and OED status will be displayed. If the business/firm name and address is incorrect, please go to the OED Registered practitioner portal to update the information.

### ID.me verification name does not match OED name

If after entering your registration/recognition number, the names from the ID.me verification process and the name provided in the OED Registered practitioner portal do not match in our system, you will receive an error message directing you to contact the Patent Electronic Business Center.

### Registration/recognition number is not in active status

If your registration/recognition number is not in "active" status, you will not be able to complete the self-enrollment process. You must contact The Office of Enrollment and Discipline or access the "Registered practitioner portal" to review your information.

### Registration/recognition number currently in use

If the error message, "The entered registration/recognition number is currently in use." is displayed, your registration/recognition number is currently linked to an active Patent Center account and you will not be able to complete the self-enrollment process.

Possible scenarios that would cause this error message to display are:

1) Moving to a new firm and your registration/recognition number is linked to the previous firm's email address.
   - a) Contact the Patent Electronic Business Center to assist with updating your registration/recognition number to your new email address.

2) The entered registration/recognition number belongs to another practitioner.
   - a) Select the "Back" button to enter your correct registration/recognition number.

### Invalid registration/recognition number

The entered registration number does not exist in USPTO systems. You will not be able to complete self-enrollment until a valid registration number is entered. Please verify and enter your registration number.

### Too many failed attempts

Please note that after three failed attempts to provide a valid registration number, the account will be locked from further attempts to self-enroll in Patent Center. Please contact the Patent Electronic Business Center to unlock your account and to receive assistance self-enrolling. Please provide the RequestID number provided in the message.

## Step 4: Selecting customer numbers

### No customer numbers are linked to your registration/recognition number

After verifying your registration/recognition number, if no customer numbers are associated with your registration/recognition number in the USPTO system, you will be directed to the "Review and confirm" page to review all information. If all information is correct, check the "I confirm this information is correct" checkbox and select the "Complete self-enrollment" button to submit and complete your self-enrollment process.

### Customer numbers are linked to your registration/recognition number

After verifying your registration/recognition number, any customer numbers associated with your registration/recognition number in the USPTO system will be displayed. You have the option to select all, none or some customer numbers. The process provides the option to select all customer numbers using the "Select all XX customer numbers" link when there are more customer numbers that can be displayed on a single page.

## Step 5: Review and confirm

If all information and applicable customer numbers are correct, select the "I confirm all information is correct" checkbox, and the subscriber agreement checkbox. You can then complete the self-enrollment by selecting the "Complete self-enrollment" button.

## Step 6: Successful completion of self-enrollment

Upon successful completion of self-enrollment, the image below will display and a confirmation email will be sent to your USPTO.gov account email address. You will use this same email address to log into Patent Center as a registered user.
