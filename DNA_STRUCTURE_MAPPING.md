# DNA Structure ↔ Scientific View ↔ Biological Systems ↔ Periodic Elements

## Core DNA Components

Scientists view DNA primarily as a double-helix molecule that stores genetic information, composed of nucleotides linked in a sugar-phosphate backbone. It's not just a static ladder but a dynamic structure that unwinds, replicates, and interacts with proteins for gene expression. Modern views (as of 2025) incorporate epigenetics, where chemical modifications like methylation influence how DNA is "read" without changing the sequence, and CRISPR-era insights show it's editable like code.

## DNA Replication & Repair

Scientists see replication as a semi-conservative process (each new strand uses one old as template), involving enzymes like helicase (unwinds), polymerase (adds nucleotides), and ligase (seals). Repair mechanisms (e.g., mismatch repair, base excision) act like error-correcting code to maintain fidelity, with 2025 advancements in real-time sequencing revealing rare mutations in vivo.

## Gene Expression & Epigenetics

Transcription (DNA to RNA) and translation (RNA to protein) are central, with regulatory elements like promoters and enhancers acting as switches. Epigenetics adds layers: methylation silences genes, acetylation opens chromatin. In 2025, AI models predict 3D DNA folding (e.g., via AlphaFold extensions) to understand long-range interactions.
