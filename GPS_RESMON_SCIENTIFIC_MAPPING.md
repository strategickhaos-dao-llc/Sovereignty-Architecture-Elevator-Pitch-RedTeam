## Core Components (GPS)

Scientists view GPS as a satellite-based navigation system using trilateration from atomic clock signals to determine position, with longitude (east-west) and latitude (north-south) as spherical coordinates on Earth's ellipsoid model (e.g., WGS84). As of 2025, enhancements include multi-GNSS integration (GPS + Galileo + BeiDou), AI for urban multipath correction, and quantum clocks for sub-meter accuracy, discussed at ION GNSS+ 2025.
