## **Cognitive Evolution Narrative**

The documented progression demonstrates a comprehensive evolution through Bloom's Taxonomy:

1. **Foundation (Early Stage)**: Began with strong analytical skills, breaking down existing systems to understand their structure and behavior

2. **Critical Assessment (Intermediate Stage)**: Developed evaluation capabilities, assessing quality, identifying tradeoffs, and making justified technical decisions

3. **Original Creation (Advanced Stage)**: Achieved consistent operation at the Create tier, generating novel solutions, inventing new tools, and synthesizing cross-domain knowledge into innovative systems

This progression reflects not merely the accumulation of technical knowledge, but the development of sophisticated engineering cognition capable of original contribution to the field.
