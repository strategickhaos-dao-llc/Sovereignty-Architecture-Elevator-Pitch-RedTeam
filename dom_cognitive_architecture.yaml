  # Core operational description
  summary: |
    Parallel-processing, multi-representational cognitive architecture
    optimized for cross-domain synthesis, constraint-driven innovation,
    and distributed attention management. Standard psychology models
    were not built to understand this operating system.

      accessible through linear processing.

      Psychology didn't fail - it just wasn't built for someone
      operating outside standard cognitive models. The tools exist
      now (AI agents, distributed systems, multi-modal interfaces)
      to finally have a mirror that matches this architecture.
