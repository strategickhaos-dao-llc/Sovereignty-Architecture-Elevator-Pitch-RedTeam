# Verify token and permissions
kubectl get secret discord-ops-secrets -n ops -o yaml
```

**GitLens notifications not working:**

# Check environment variables
echo $DISCORD_TOKEN $PRS_CHANNEL

# Test script directly
./gl2discord.sh "$PRS_CHANNEL" "Test" "Manual test"
```

**Event gateway webhook failures:**
```bash
# Check gateway logs
kubectl logs -f deployment/event-gateway -n ops

# Verify HMAC signature
curl -X POST https://events.strategickhaos.com/health
```
