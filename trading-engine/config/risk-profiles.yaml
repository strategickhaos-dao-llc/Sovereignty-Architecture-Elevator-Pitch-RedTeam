  # Ultra-Conservative: Absolute minimal risk
  ultra_conservative:
    risk_per_trade: "0.25%"
    max_drawdown: "1.0%"
    failure_threshold: 50
    description: "Maximum safety, minimal risk exposure"
    use_case: "Learning, testing, small accounts"
    
  # Conservative: Low risk, high safety
  conservative:
    risk_per_trade: "0.5%"
    max_drawdown: "2.0%"
    failure_threshold: 75
    description: "Conservative risk management for steady growth"
    use_case: "Risk-averse traders, retirement accounts"
    
  # Default: The mythic 0.69% / 3.37%
  default:
    risk_per_trade: "0.69%"
    max_drawdown: "3.37%"
    failure_threshold: 99
    description: "Balanced risk-reward with mythic parameters"
    use_case: "Standard trading, balanced approach"
    
  # Aggressive: Higher risk, more opportunity
  aggressive:
    risk_per_trade: "1.0%"

# How to use these profiles:
# 
# 1. Choose a profile that matches your risk tolerance
# 2. Update pid-ranco-mythic.yaml with the values
# 3. Configure matching values in NinjaTrader strategy properties
# 
# Example for Conservative profile:
#   In pid-ranco-mythic.yaml:
#     risk_parameters:
#       risk_per_trade: "0.5%"
#       max_drawdown: "2.0%"
#   
#   In NinjaTrader properties:
#     Risk Per Trade: 0.005
#     Max Drawdown: 0.02

# Account Size Recommendations
account_sizing:
  minimum_recommended: "$5,000"
  conservative_minimum: "$10,000"
  comfortable_minimum: "$25,000"
  
  reasoning: |
    With 0.69% risk per trade:
    - $5,000 account = $34.50 risk per trade
    - $10,000 account = $69.00 risk per trade
    - $25,000 account = $172.50 risk per trade
    
    Ensure your position sizing allows for meaningful trades
    while respecting the risk percentage limits.

# Drawdown Recovery Math
drawdown_recovery:
  explanation: |
    Understanding drawdown recovery requirements:
    
    Loss %  | Required Gain to Recover
    --------|------------------------
    1%      | 1.01%
    2%      | 2.04%
    3%      | 3.09%
    5%      | 5.26%
    10%     | 11.11%
    20%     | 25.00%
    50%     | 100.00%
    
    This is why aggressive drawdown limits are dangerous:
    - 3.37% drawdown requires 3.49% gain to recover
    - 10% drawdown requires 11.11% gain to recover
    
    The mythic 3.37% limit ensures recovery remains achievable.

# Session Loss Thresholds
session_thresholds:
  explanation: |
    The apoptosis protocol (99 losses) protects against:
    
    1. Strategy Logic Errors
       - If losing 99 times in a session, something is wrong
       - Better to stop and review than continue bleeding
    
    2. Market Regime Changes
       - Strategy designed for certain conditions
       - 99 losses suggests conditions have changed
       - Apoptosis = forced review and adaptation
    
    3. Psychological Protection
       - Prevents revenge trading
       - Forces cool-down period
       - Protects trader mental state
    
    Adjustment Guidelines:
    - More trades per session → keep 99
    - Fewer trades per session → reduce to 50-75
    - Very conservative → reduce to 25-50

# Real-World Examples
examples:
  day_trader:
    profile: "conservative"
    account: "$25,000"
    risk_per_trade: "0.5%"
    max_drawdown: "2.0%"
    trades_per_day: "5-10"
    max_daily_risk: "$125 (0.5% × $25k)"
    drawdown_stop: "$500 (2.0% × $25k)"
    notes: "Risk $125/trade, stop at $500 total loss"
  
  swing_trader:
    profile: "default"
    account: "$50,000"
    risk_per_trade: "0.69%"
    max_drawdown: "3.37%"
    trades_per_week: "3-5"
    max_trade_risk: "$345 (0.69% × $50k)"
    drawdown_stop: "$1,685 (3.37% × $50k)"
    notes: "Balanced approach for multi-day holds"
  
  professional:
    profile: "aggressive"
    account: "$100,000"
    risk_per_trade: "1.0%"
    max_drawdown: "5.0%"
    trades_per_day: "10-20"
    max_trade_risk: "$1,000 (1.0% × $100k)"
    drawdown_stop: "$5,000 (5.0% × $100k)"
    notes: "Active trading with tighter management"

# Testing Recommendations
testing:
  simulation_duration:
    minimum: "30 days"
    recommended: "90 days"
    ideal: "6 months"
  
  what_to_validate:
    - "Apoptosis triggers appropriately (not too early/late)"
    - "Voice/mic failures handled gracefully"
    - "Drawdown limits enforced correctly"
    - "Position sizing matches account value"
    - "Emergency shutdown works as expected"
    - "Discord notifications arrive correctly"
  
  progression:
    1: "Paper trading (simulation)"
    2: "Micro account ($500-1000)"
    3: "Small live account ($5,000)"
    4: "Standard account ($10,000+)"
    5: "Full deployment"

# Important Reminders
reminders:
  - "Always start in simulation mode"
  - "Test apoptosis protocol manually"
  - "Verify Discord notifications work"
  - "Review logs daily for first 30 days"
  - "Never skip the 'I UNDERSTAND THE RISK' confirmation"
  - "Keep YAML and C# risk values synchronized"
  - "Monitor peak equity tracking accuracy"
  - "Validate voice/mic integration thoroughly"

# Philosophy
philosophy: |
  These profiles maintain the core principle:
  "Guardrails around a supernova"
  
  Even at "very_aggressive", the safety measures remain:
  - Hard position limits
  - Automatic strategy disable on breach
  - Exception handling with emergency shutdown
  - Session loss counting with apoptosis
  - Voice failure treated as silence
  
  The poetry scales with risk, but the safety doesn't compromise.
  
  From 0.25% ultra-conservative to 2.0% very-aggressive,
  the kill-switch layer protects against catastrophic loss.
  
  Choose your risk level, but respect the guardrails.
