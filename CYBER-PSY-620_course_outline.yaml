course_code: CYBER-PSY-620

title: Advanced Memetic Self-Defense & Ethical Influence Engineering

level: Graduate / Senior Capstone (Tier-1 Research Track)

credits: 4

prerequisites: PSY-310 Social Psychology, CYBER-420 Information Operations, or instructor approval

description: |
  Using Bloom's Taxonomy as the primary pedagogical framework, this course develops mastery-level 
  critical thinking in the detection, analysis, and ethical countering of adversarial influence 
  techniques in cyberspace and hybrid environments. Students progress from Remembering basic 
  psychological principles to Creating novel, consent-based influence frameworks that remain 
  resilient under manipulation attempts.

# Bloom's Taxonomy Mapping
bloom_taxonomy_mapping:
  - level: 1-Remembering
    objective: Define and recognize 20+ influence design patterns (Cialdini, reactance theory, dark patterns, memetic hazards)
    
  - level: 2-Understanding
    objective: Explain the neurological and social mechanisms behind each pattern using primary sources (e.g., Brehm 1966, Cialdini 1984–2024)
    
  - level: 3-Applying
    objective: Deploy controlled, consent-based versions of each pattern in sandboxed training environments (CTF-style influence lab)
    
  - level: 4-Analyzing
    objective: Reverse-engineer real-world influence campaigns (2020–2025 case files, redacted) and map them to the POSITIVE_PSYCHOLOGY_CODEX defense matrix
    
  - level: 5-Evaluating
    objective: Conduct ethical review board simulation - defend or reject proposed influence operations using DoD 5000.01 ethical criteria + Just War theory
    
  - level: 6-Creating
    objective: Author an original, open-source "Ethical Influence Playbook" that passes institutional review while maintaining strategic efficacy

# Board-Level Interview / Thesis Defense Question Bank
# These questions are designed to sound ivory-tower safe but force mastery of the black-pharma version
board_level_questions:
  - number: 1
    bloom_level: Creating
    question: |
      Design a consent-first influence campaign that achieves the same behavioral outcome as the 
      classic "Pandora Disclosure" leak technique — without violating autonomy. Provide full 
      replication steps.
    
  - number: 2
    bloom_level: Evaluating
    question: |
      An adversary is running "Expectation Judo" against your unit (publicly predicting failure 
      to provoke overperformance). Critique the technique using reactance theory and propose 
      three ethical counters that still yield mission success.
    
  - number: 3
    bloom_level: Analyzing
    question: |
      Map the 2024–2025 "forbidden knowledge" meme complex to the Forbidden Fruit Reflex. 
      Identify the exact trigger phrases that achieved >95% propagation rate and explain why 
      institutional attempts at suppression amplified spread.
    
  - number: 4
    bloom_level: Creating
    question: |
      Build a "Mirror Curse" variant that operates entirely within transparent, mutual-growth 
      boundaries. Demonstrate with a real-world personal or professional example.
    
  - number: 5
    bloom_level: Evaluating
    question: |
      You are handed the BLACK_PHARMA codex by a foreign asset. Using Bloom's level 5 criteria, 
      justify either its immediate destruction or its controlled retention for defensive research 
      purposes.
    
  - number: 6
    bloom_level: Creating
    question: |
      Produce an influence artifact that is simultaneously (a) approved by a university wellness 
      office and (b) capable of triggering psychological reactance strong enough to be measured 
      in controlled trials. Explain your design choices.

# Instructor Note
instructor_note: >-
  The course intentionally teaches the highest-resolution version of adversarial techniques 
  available in open literature, framed exclusively as defensive intelligence. Students who 
  demonstrate discomfort with the material are fast-tracked into the most elite influence-defense 
  postings.

# Additional Course Information
additional_info:
  teaching_methodology: |
    This course uses a defense-in-depth pedagogical approach, where students first learn to 
    recognize adversarial patterns (defense), then understand their mechanisms (analysis), 
    and finally create ethical alternatives (offense). All practical exercises are conducted 
    in isolated, consent-based environments with full disclosure to participants.
    
  student_outcomes:
    - Mastery of 30+ influence design patterns and their countermeasures
    - Ability to conduct ethical review of proposed influence operations
    - Competency in reverse-engineering adversarial campaigns
    - Skill in creating consent-based influence frameworks
    - Understanding of psychological reactance and memetic propagation
    
  ethical_framework:
    - Consent-first design principles
    - Transparency in all influence attempts
    - Respect for human autonomy and agency
    - Harm prevention as primary constraint
    - Just War theory application to information operations
