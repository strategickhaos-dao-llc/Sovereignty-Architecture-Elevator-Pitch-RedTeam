Navigate to /search\n2. Enter payload: ' OR '1'='1\n3. Observe database error revealing injection\n4. Extract data using UNION queries\n\n### Step 3: Capturing the Flag\nExecute the exploit and observe the response containing the flag.\n\n### Code:\n```\ncurl 'https://example.com/search?q=%27+OR+%271%27%3D%271'\n```\n\n### What We Learned\nThis challenge demonstrates a real-world vulnerability. In production:\n- Disable search functionality\n- Use parameterized queries\n\n### Prevention\nhttps://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/SQL_Injection",
