  solution: '## Solution Writeup


    ### Step 1: Reconnaissance

    The application fails to properly sanitize user input in the search parameter,
    allowing SQL injection attacks that can compromise the entire database....


    ### Step 2: Exploitation

    1. Navigate to /search

    2. Enter payload: '' OR ''1''=''1

    3. Observe database error revealing injection

    4. Extract data using UNION queries


    ### Step 3: Capturing the Flag

    Execute the exploit and observe the response containing the flag.


    ### Code:

    ```

    curl ''https://example.com/search?q=%27+OR+%271%27%3D%271''

    ```


    ### What We Learned

    This challenge demonstrates a real-world vulnerability. In production:

    - Disable search functionality

    - Use parameterized queries
