# StrategicKhaos Product Build Spec
# Version: 2025-11-30
# Purpose: Mission file for AI-driven educational swarm rollout
#
# USAGE:
# Paste this YAML into Claude.ai (or any LLM) with the prompt:
# "Use this YAML as the project spec and generate all defined deliverables."
#
# This YAML serves as the "mission brain" that tells the AI:
# - What to build
# - For whom
# - Legal and style constraints
# - And outputs shippable docs departments can consume
