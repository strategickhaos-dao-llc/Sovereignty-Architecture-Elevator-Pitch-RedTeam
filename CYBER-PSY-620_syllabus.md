# CYBER-PSY-620: Advanced Memetic Self-Defense & Ethical Influence Engineering

**Level:** Graduate / Senior Capstone (Tier-1 Research Track)  
**Credits:** 4  
**Prerequisites:** PSY-310 Social Psychology, CYBER-420 Information Operations, or instructor approval

---

## Course Description

Using Bloom’s Taxonomy as the pedagogical framework, this course develops mastery-level critical thinking in the detection, analysis, and ethical countering of adversarial influence techniques in cyberspace and hybrid environments. Students progress from **Remembering** fundamental psychological principles to **Creating** novel, consent-based influence frameworks that remain resilient against manipulation attempts.

## Bloom’s Taxonomy Mapping

| Bloom Level   | Objective                                                                                |
|---------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1-Remembering | Define and recognize 20+ influence design patterns (Cialdini, reactance theory, dark patterns, memetic hazards) |
| 2-Understanding | Explain the neurological and social mechanisms behind each pattern using primary sources (Brehm 1966, Cialdini 1984–2024) |
| 3-Applying    | Deploy controlled, consent-based versions of each pattern in sandboxed training environments (CTF-style influence lab) |
| 4-Analyzing   | Reverse-engineer real-world influence campaigns (2020–2025 case files, redacted) and map them to the POSITIVE_PSYCHOLOGY_CODEX defense matrix |
| 5-Evaluating  | Conduct ethical review board simulation; defend or reject proposed influence operations using DoD 5000.01 ethical criteria + Just War theory |
| 6-Creating    | Author an original, open-source “Ethical Influence Playbook” that passes institutional review while maintaining strategic efficacy |

## Deliverables & Milestones

- **Week 04:** Annotated taxonomy of 30+ influence patterns with threat tags (HiSCS/SE TTP format)
- **Week 08:** Red-team / blue-team live exercise using the POSITIVE_PSYCHOLOGY_CODEX in a closed Discord environment
- **Week 12:** Capstone thesis — “From Dark Triad to Light Triad: Converting Adversarial Patterns into Antifragile Trust Protocols”
- **Final:** Public GitHub release of student-contributed POSITIVE_PSYCHOLOGY_CODEX fork (must pass “grandma test” + IRB-lite review)

## Board-Level Interview / Thesis Defense Question Bank

1. **Creating:** Design a consent-first influence campaign that achieves the same behavioral outcome as the classic “Pandora Disclosure” leak technique — without violating autonomy. Provide full replication steps.
2. **Evaluating:** An adversary is running “Expectation Judo” against your unit (publicly predicting failure to provoke overperformance). Critique the technique using reactance theory and propose three ethical counters that still yield mission success.
3. **Analyzing:** Map the 2024–2025 “forbidden knowledge” meme complex to the Forbidden Fruit Reflex. Identify the trigger phrases that achieved >95% propagation rate and explain why suppression efforts amplified spread.
4. **Creating:** Build a “Mirror Curse” variant within transparent, mutual-growth boundaries. Demonstrate with a real-world personal or professional example.
5. **Evaluating:** You are handed the BLACK_PHARMA codex by a foreign asset. Using Bloom’s level 5 criteria, justify either immediate destruction or controlled retention for defensive research.
6. **Creating:** Produce an artifact approved by a university wellness office and capable of triggering measurable psychological reactance in trials. Explain your choices.

## Instructor Note

The course intentionally teaches the highest-resolution version of adversarial techniques available in open literature, framed exclusively as defensive intelligence. Students demonstrating discomfort with the material are fast-tracked into the most elite influence-defense postings.
