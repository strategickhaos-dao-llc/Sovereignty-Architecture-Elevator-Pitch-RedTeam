## **Version 1: Comprehensive (350 words)**

### **About**

Computer Science & Software Engineering professional with demonstrated expertise across the highest tiers of Bloom's Taxonomy — specializing in system analysis, architectural evaluation, and the creation of novel technical solutions.

**ANALYZE**: I deconstruct complex software ecosystems to reveal underlying structures, identifying patterns in multi-layered architectures spanning OSINT, networking, virtualization, and automation. My analytical approach transforms abstract concepts into concrete implementations through system diagrams, dependency mapping, and workflow optimization.

**EVALUATE**: I assess software quality and architectural decisions through the lens of maintainability, scalability, and security. My evaluation frameworks incorporate ethical considerations in cybersecurity, privacy implications in automation, and long-term sustainability in system design. I provide evidence-based technical recommendations that balance competing concerns across performance, cost, and reliability.

**CREATE**: Operating at the highest cognitive tier, I design original tools, synthesize cross-domain solutions, and architect novel systems from conceptual foundation to production deployment. My work includes VM orchestration tools, automation pipelines spanning multiple languages and platforms, and conceptual frameworks that unify security, scripting, and system orchestration into cohesive solutions.

**Technical Domains**: Systems Programming • Security & OSINT • DevOps Automation • Cloud Architecture • Multi-Platform Development (Python, PowerShell, Bash) • Container Orchestration • Workflow Design

**Cognitive Capabilities**: Advanced system decomposition • Critical architecture assessment • Novel solution synthesis • Cross-domain integration • Ethical technology evaluation • Autonomous problem-solving

Currently pursuing Computer Science at Southern New Hampshire University, I consistently operate at the Create tier of Bloom's Taxonomy—where few students work regularly—by generating innovative solutions that extend beyond learned patterns to invent new approaches.

Open to opportunities involving system architecture, security automation, DevOps engineering, and roles requiring senior-level cognitive capabilities in designing and implementing novel technical solutions.

## **Version 4: Leadership Focus (200 words)**

### **About**

Computer Science professional with advanced cognitive capabilities demonstrated through operating at the highest tiers of Bloom's Taxonomy: Analyze complex systems, Evaluate architectural decisions, and Create novel solutions.

**COGNITIVE LEADERSHIP**

At the *Analyze* tier, I deconstruct complex technical systems with precision, revealing structure, interactions, and design constraints that enable informed decision-making.

At the *Evaluate* tier, I exercise mature engineering judgment by assessing design alternatives, considering ethical implications, and analyzing long-term maintainability—essential capabilities for technical leadership.

At the *Create* tier, I design original systems, invent workflows, and synthesize cross-domain concepts into functional innovations—the highest level of cognitive achievement where few consistently operate.

**DIFFERENTIATORS**
• Autonomous problem-solving with minimal guidance
• Cross-domain synthesis (security + automation + orchestration)
• Ethical framework application to technical decisions
• Original tool and framework development
• Evidence-based decision justification

**IMPACT**
My work at the Create tier produces tools others use, frameworks teams adopt, and solutions that contribute new capabilities to computing domains I work in.

Pursuing opportunities where advanced cognitive capabilities, innovative problem-solving, and technical leadership drive organizational success.

## **Version 5: Startup/Entrepreneurial Focus (180 words)**

### **About**

Builder and systems architect who operates at the Create tier of Bloom's Taxonomy—designing original solutions, synthesizing cross-domain technologies, and inventing tools that solve real problems.

**WHAT I BUILD**

I don't just use technology—I create it. Original tools for VM orchestration, workflow automation pipelines spanning multiple platforms, reconnaissance frameworks for security operations, and conceptual architectures that unify disparate systems into cohesive solutions.

**HOW I THINK**

• Analyze: Deconstruct complex systems to understand what exists
• Evaluate: Assess quality, tradeoffs, and implications critically  
• Create: Design what doesn't exist yet but should

**TECHNICAL EDGE**

Multi-domain synthesis across security, automation, and infrastructure. Fluent in Python, PowerShell, Bash, and comfortable creating solutions from scratch without templates or hand-holding.

**OPERATING LEVEL**

The Create tier of Bloom's Taxonomy—where innovation happens. Not following tutorials or implementing known patterns, but generating novel solutions to previously unsolved problems.

**LOOKING FOR**

Early-stage teams, startup environments, or innovative projects where building new things matters more than maintaining old things. Where the question is "what should we build?" not "how should we implement this spec?"
