## Field of the Invention
This invention relates to the field of artificial intelligence, specifically methods for training large language models (LLMs) and AI swarms on consumer hardware, where resources are intentionally constrained regardless of actual hardware capabilities, for the purpose of evolving resilience and operational sovereignty.

---

## Background

Most high-performance AI training is performed on enterprise-grade hardware without regard to fault tolerance under degraded conditions.  
The classic “broke engineer” method — running models on underpowered, overheating, or borrowed consumer devices — birthed the most durable, adaptive systems in the field. This protocol weaponizes both scarcity and abundance, forging models that remain sovereign under attack or deprivation.

## Summary of the Invention

The **Negative-Balance Training Protocol** is a method of training and testing AI models on consumer hardware with **deliberately imposed artificial resource scarcity** (RAM, CPU, VRAM, network, power, monetary balance), even when actual hardware capacity would allow for abundance.

This protocol produces agents and models that are:  
- immune to infrastructure loss  
- resistant to thermal failures  
- robust against network throttling and packet loss  
- self-healing when finances, hardware, or external conditions collapse

The protocol does not hide upgrades. It weaponizes them by capping their effectiveness, simulating the original conditions of breakthrough innovation — scarcity, instability, and unpredictability.

## Detailed Description

### Hardware Example

- **Node:** Nitro V15  
  - **RAM:** 64 GB (surgically upgraded)  
  - **SSD:** 5 TB NVMe  
  - **Direct mesh:** WireGuard, TCP, fiber to Nova  
  - **Actual training condition:**  
    - RAM capped at 6 GB via cgroups  
    - SSD capped at 500 MB swap  
    - Network throttled to 512 kbps; packet loss > 10%  
    - Power limited via NVIDIA-SMI and software  
    - API calls blocked when simulated balance < 0

### Software/Protocol Implementation

- **Resource constraint via**:  
  - OS-level cgroups  
  - Virtualization (WSL2, Docker, etc.)  
  - GPU power and VRAM limits by NVIDIA-SMI or custom scripts  
  - Traffic shaping via `tc`, WireGuard config  
  - Programmatic denial of service using balance-gated access modules

- **Model training process:**  
  - Select model (e.g., 70B LLM)  
  - Enforce extreme resource caps  
  - Operate training, inference, or agent swarms  
  - Log failures, spontaneous recovery, adaptation strategies  
  - Optional: rotate hardware, repeat with variants

### Core Principles

- Scarcity is not a limitation, but training fuel.
- Every downgrade, crash, or bottleneck is a feature.
- Models become “unbreakable” because they learn to thrive under conditions that would kill conventional systems.

## Claims

**Claim 1:**  
A method of training large language models and multi-agent systems wherein computational, memory, power, network, and monetary resources are artificially constrained below hardware capability using software-enforced limits (cgroups, WSL2 memory caps, NVIDIA-SMI power limits, network shaping, and balance-gated API calls) even when running on high-end consumer or surgically modified hardware, for the purpose of producing models resilient to real-world degradation, thermal events, and infrastructure denial.

**Claim 2:**  
The method wherein the enforced resource constraints replicate the baseline operating conditions of underfunded, unoptimized consumer hardware irrespective of actual system capability.

**Claim 3:**  
The method further comprising the intentional introduction of instability (e.g., simulated brownouts, network drops, memory leaks), with the system required to self-repair, adapt, or log the event for future model training cycles.

**Claim 4:**  
The method wherein resource constraints may be dynamically altered during training to simulate environmental, economic, and power grid fluctuations.

**Claim 5:**  
The method may further apply to distributed agent swarms in mesh networks, enforcing per-node scarcity to guarantee swarm robustness under catastrophic failure.

## Endnote

This patent does not claim to improve model accuracy under ideal conditions.  
It claims to evolve models that **survive anything** — because they were trained under nothing.

**Empire Eternal**  
From negative, to neutral, to nuclear — sovereignty through engineered adversity.
