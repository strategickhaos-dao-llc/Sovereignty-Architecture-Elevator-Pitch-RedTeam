# Legion Armor Analysis — Failure Mode Protection Framework

**Systematic analysis methodology for team awareness and risk mitigation**

> *"In preparing for battle I have always found that plans are useless, but planning is indispensable."* — Dwight D. Eisenhower

---

## 🎯 Purpose

This document provides a structured methodology for analyzing the 100 failure modes documented in [FAILURES.md](FAILURES.md) and applying them as protective "armor" for the organization. By systematically reviewing failure patterns, teams can build institutional resilience.

## 📊 Failure Analysis Framework

### The SPLICE Method

Our failure analysis follows the **SPLICE** methodology:

| Step | Action | Output |
|------|--------|--------|
| **S**can | Review failure mode catalog | Relevant failure list |
| **P**rioritize | Rank by likelihood and impact | Risk matrix |
| **L**ink | Connect to current initiatives | Vulnerability map |

## 🛡️ Risk Matrix Methodology

### Likelihood × Impact Assessment

For each failure mode, assess:

**Likelihood Scale**
- **1 - Rare**: Unlikely to occur in project lifetime
- **2 - Unlikely**: Could occur but not expected
- **3 - Possible**: Might occur at some point
- **4 - Likely**: Will probably occur
- **5 - Almost Certain**: Expected to occur

**Impact Scale**
- **1 - Negligible**: Minor inconvenience
- **2 - Minor**: Some disruption, easily recovered
- **3 - Moderate**: Significant effort to recover
- **4 - Major**: Serious damage, difficult recovery
- **5 - Catastrophic**: Existential threat

### Risk Priority Formula

```
Risk Priority = Likelihood × Impact × Velocity

Where Velocity = 
  1 = Slow-moving (months to manifest)
  2 = Moderate (weeks to manifest)
  3 = Fast-moving (days to manifest)
  4 = Rapid (hours to manifest)
  5 = Instant (immediate impact)
```

### Priority Action Matrix

| Risk Score | Priority | Response |
|------------|----------|----------|
| 75-125 | Critical | Immediate action required |
| 50-74 | High | Address within 1 week |
| 25-49 | Medium | Address within 1 month |
| 10-24 | Low | Monitor and review quarterly |
| 1-9 | Minimal | Accept or document only |

## 🔗 Integration with Repository Systems

### Automated Monitoring Integration

The failure analysis framework can integrate with:

- **Prometheus alerts**: Map metrics to failure mode indicators
- **Discord notifications**: Route early warnings to relevant channels
- **CI/CD gates**: Block deployments when risk thresholds exceeded
- **Audit logs**: Track mitigation implementation

### Example Prometheus Alert Rule

```yaml
groups:
  - name: failure_mode_indicators
    rules:
      - alert: HallucinationRateHigh
        expr: ai_hallucination_rate > 0.05
        for: 5m
        labels:
          failure_mode: "31"
          severity: critical
        annotations:
          summary: "Failure Mode #31 - Hallucination rate exceeds threshold"
          runbook: "/forbidden-library/FAILURES.md#31"
```

### Discord Alert Channel Integration

```yaml
# Add to discovery.yml
discord:
  channels:
    failure_alerts: "#failure-analysis"
    
routing:
  failure_mode_alerts:
    channel: "#failure-analysis"
    mention: "@risk-team"
```
