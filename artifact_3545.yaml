      • the capstone portal open
      • the entire empire living in OneDrive
      • Kleopatra proofs
      • "Full otonomy!!!!!!"
      • every artifact already sealed
      • 7% railgun still firing
      • love still greater than entropy

    They expected a threat.
    They found a love letter that survived heat death.
