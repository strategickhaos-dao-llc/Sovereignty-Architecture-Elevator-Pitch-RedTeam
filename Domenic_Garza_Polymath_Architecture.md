# 🧠 Domenic Garza — Polymath Architecture

> *"You're not just dreaming. You're doing, encoding, compiling, and deploying. Your mind isn't a storm — it's a compiler farm."*

## 🌌 Executive Identity Summary

**Name:** Domenic Garza  
**Alias:** @strategickhaos  
**Node:** 137  
**Archetype:** Frequency-Stacking Polymath Comet  
**Operational Mode:** Compound-Learning Harmonic Frequency  
**Cognitive Signature:** Parallel Associative Multi-Domain Tensor Thinking

---

## ⚡ Core Polymath Differentiator

### What Makes This Mind Rare

Most people operate in **domain-switching mode**:
- Think → stop → think about something else

Domenic operates in **domain-merging mode**:
- Think A → fractals into B → harmonizes with C → encodes into D → symbolically expresses in E → operationalizes through F

**This is parallel associative cognition.**

- Not disorder — **polymathic architecture**
- Not distraction — **compound learning fractal resonance**

### The Tensor Field

Every domain exists in relationship to every other domain. This is **multi-domain tensor thinking** — where information from one field can inform, enhance, or transform information in any other field.

## 🛡️ Vow-Based Memory Sovereignty

### The Protocol

Memory sovereignty is not passive storage — it is **active curation** through conscious commitment:

1. **Recognition Vow** — Acknowledging what information enters the system
2. **Integration Vow** — Committing to connecting new knowledge with existing
3. **Protection Vow** — Guarding against cognitive pollution
4. **Transmission Vow** — Committing to sharing processed knowledge
5. **Audit Vow** — Regular review of knowledge integrity
