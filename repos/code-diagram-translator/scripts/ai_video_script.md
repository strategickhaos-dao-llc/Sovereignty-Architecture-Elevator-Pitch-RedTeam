# 90-Second AI Video Script
## Code-to-Diagram Translator (IDEA_002)
### The First Child - Born from the Birthday Constellation

---

## 🎬 VIDEO STORYBOARD

**Duration:** 90 seconds  
**Style:** Modern tech explainer with animated diagrams  
**Tone:** Professional yet accessible, hint of excitement  

---

### SCENE 1: THE PROBLEM (0:00 - 0:15)

**VISUAL:** Split screen - left shows developer drowning in code, right shows confused stakeholder looking at whiteboard

**VOICEOVER:**
> "You've built something amazing. But explaining it? That's another challenge entirely. Stakeholders don't read code. New developers need hours to understand your architecture. And documentation? Always outdated."

**TEXT ON SCREEN:** "The Gap Between Code and Understanding"

---

### SCENE 2: INTRODUCING THE SOLUTION (0:15 - 0:30)

**VISUAL:** Code-to-Diagram Translator logo animates in, code files flow in from left, transform into beautiful diagrams on right

**VOICEOVER:**
> "Introducing Code-to-Diagram Translator. It reads your codebase and automatically generates clear, beautiful architecture diagrams. In seconds."

**TEXT ON SCREEN:** "Code In → Diagrams Out"

---

### SCENE 3: HOW IT WORKS (0:30 - 0:50)

**VISUAL:** Animated flow showing AST analysis, with code symbols floating up and connecting into a diagram

**VOICEOVER:**
> "Using advanced AST analysis, we understand your code's structure - classes, functions, dependencies, relationships. Then we transform that understanding into Mermaid, PlantUML, or D2 diagrams that anyone can read."

**TEXT ON SCREEN:** 
- "Python ✓"
- "JavaScript ✓"
- "Go ✓"
- "TypeScript ✓"

---

### SCENE 4: USE CASES (0:50 - 1:05)

**VISUAL:** Quick montage of diagrams being used - in documentation, presentations, code reviews

**VOICEOVER:**
> "Onboard new team members in minutes instead of days. Keep documentation always in sync. Review architecture with non-technical stakeholders. All from a single command."

**TEXT ON SCREEN:** 
```bash
python main.py /your/repo --all
```

---

### SCENE 5: THE BIGGER PICTURE (1:05 - 1:20)

**VISUAL:** Zoom out to show Code-to-Diagram as one star in a constellation of tools, with the Strategickhaos logo

**VOICEOVER:**
> "Code-to-Diagram Translator is the first child of the Birthday Constellation - part of Strategickhaos DAO's vision for AI-governed, self-replicating software infrastructure."

**TEXT ON SCREEN:** "IDEA_002 of 100 Seeds"

---

### SCENE 6: CALL TO ACTION (1:20 - 1:30)

**VISUAL:** Terminal showing installation, then transitioning to final logo

**VOICEOVER:**
> "Ready to turn your code into clarity? Get started now. Open source. Zero cost. Infinite insight."

**TEXT ON SCREEN:** 
- "github.com/strategickhaos/code-diagram-translator"
- "Star ⭐ | Fork 🍴 | Contribute 🤝"
