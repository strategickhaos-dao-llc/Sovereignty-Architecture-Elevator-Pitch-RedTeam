# 90-Second AI Video Script - Q034 / IDEA_002

**TITLE:** "From Code to Diagrams: Seeing Your Architecture Clearly"

---

## Script Timeline

### [0–10s]
Hi, I'm your architecture translator.  
In the next 90 seconds, we're going to turn raw source code… into a living diagram.

### [10–25s]
When you look at a big codebase, your brain is trying to keep track of:
- Which modules exist
- Which functions live where
- How classes and methods relate

But the code doesn't show that structure explicitly.  
You have to reconstruct it mentally every time.

### [25–45s]
The Code-to-Diagram Translator does that reconstruction for you.

You send it source code — starting with Python —  
and it builds a graph:

- A **module** node at the root  
- **Function** and **class** nodes underneath  
- Optional **method** nodes for class internals  
- And **edges** that say "this contains that"

It doesn't guess business meaning.  
It simply exposes the skeleton your brain was already trying to infer.

### [45–65s]
Why is this powerful?

Because once you have the graph, you can:

- Render it as a visual diagram  
- Spot crowded modules and god-classes  
- See where responsibilities are clustered  
- Plan refactors based on structure, not vibes

It becomes a living x-ray of your architecture.

### [65–80s]
In this KnowledgePod, you'll:

- Send real code to the translator
- Inspect the nodes and edges it returns
- And answer one question:

> "What does this graph tell me about how I should reshape this system?"

### [80–90s]
By the end, you won't just *read* code.  
You'll see the architecture underneath it—  
and you'll know how to change it on purpose.

Let's plug in your code and watch the diagram appear.
