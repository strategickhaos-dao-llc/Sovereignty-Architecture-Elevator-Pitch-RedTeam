# Detailed explanations
question_details:
  q1:
    question: "What is the total preterm birth rate?"
    calculation: "early preterm (3.20%) + late preterm (7.20%) = 10.40%"
    method: "SUM aggregation of component rates"
    answer: "10.40%"
    
  q2:
    question: "What is the increase in preterm birth rate?"
    calculation: "9.85% - 9.63% = 0.22%"
    method: "DIFF gradient/derivative calculation"
    note: "Question asks for the INCREASE, not the absolute rate"
    answer: "0.22%"
    
  q3:
    question: "Which maternal age group has the highest late preterm rate?"
    data:
      under_20: "8.45%"
      age_20_24: "9.12%"
      age_25_29: "8.89%"
      age_30_34: "9.23%"
      age_35_39: "9.95%"
      over_40: "10.37%"
    method: "MAX comparator tree - find extremum"
    answer: "Over 40"
    rationale: "Older mothers (over 40) have the highest late preterm rate at 10.37%"

# FLAMELANG PATTERN: STACKED BAR DECOMPOSITION

  layer_insight:
    operation: "aggregate vs delta detection"
    
    patterns:
      q1:
        operation: "SUM"
        formula: "SUM(components) → total"
        implementation: "aggregate pattern - accumulator"
        
      q2:
        operation: "DIFF"
        formula: "DIFF(t2, t1) → change"
        implementation: "gradient/derivative pattern"
        
      q3:
        operation: "MAX"
        formula: "MAX(category) → extremum"
        implementation: "comparator tree pattern"

    These are the 3 fundamental reduction operations:
    - SUM → accumulator pattern
    - DIFF → gradient/derivative
    - MAX → comparator tree
    All FlameLang loops compile to one of these
    
  code_insight: |
    Functional programming perspective:
    - SUM = fold/reduce with (+) operator
    - DIFF = map with subtraction, then select
    - MAX = fold/reduce with max() comparator
    
    These operations are embarrassingly parallel and map
    directly to GPU/TPU primitives for scale.

# Learning outcomes
learning_outcomes:
  - "Decompose stacked bar charts into component calculations"
  - "Distinguish between absolute values and delta calculations"
  - "Apply comparison operations to find extremum values"
  - "Recognize fundamental reduction patterns in data analysis"
  - "Map statistical operations to compiler primitives"

# Pattern recognition

    The grade is temporary, the patterns are permanent.
    Understanding these three operations (SUM, DIFF, MAX) unlocks
    the ability to reason about any statistical analysis or
    data transformation pipeline.
