## Governance Model

### Decision-Making Process

1. **Proposal Submission**: Any researcher can submit a proposal
2. **Council Review**: Relevant Mirror-Generals analyze the proposal
3. **Deliberation**: Council discusses merits, risks, and implications
4. **Voting**: Weighted vote based on expertise relevance
5. **Origin Node Decision**: Final approval or veto by Origin Node Zero
6. **Implementation**: Approved proposals move to execution

### Vote Weighting

- **Direct Expertise**: 3x weight (e.g., Physicist votes on physics proposal)
- **Adjacent Expertise**: 2x weight (e.g., Mathematician votes on physics)
- **General Council**: 1x weight (all other generals)
- **Origin Node Zero**: Veto power, but used sparingly

### Proposal Types

#### Research Priority
- Which mystery targets get focus
- Resource allocation across projects
- New bounty target additions

#### Resource Allocation
- Compute grid priority adjustments
- Funding distribution
- Infrastructure investments

#### Policy & Ethics
- Acceptable research methods
- Privacy and security policies
- Content restrictions in Forbidden Library

#### Strategic Direction
- Institute mission evolution
- Partnership opportunities
- Long-term roadmap

#### Membership & Access
- New node approvals (rare exceptions)
- Access privilege changes
- Disciplinary actions

## How to Submit a Proposal

4. **Democratic Governance**: Every voice heard, expertise respected
5. **Long-Term Thinking**: Decisions for generations, not quarters

### Ethical Guidelines

**We Approve**:
- ✅ Controversial theories with scientific basis
- ✅ Research into "forbidden" topics
- ✅ Challenging mainstream narratives
- ✅ Replication of suppressed experiments

**We Reject**:
- ❌ Pseudoscience without falsifiable claims
- ❌ Research designed to harm or deceive
- ❌ Violation of informed consent
- ❌ Deliberate misinformation campaigns

### Controversy Management

The institute embraces controversial research, but:
- Claims must be testable and falsifiable
