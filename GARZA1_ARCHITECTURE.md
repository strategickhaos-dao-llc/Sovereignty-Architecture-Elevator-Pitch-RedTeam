### Optimization Techniques

#### 1. Spite-Driven Optimization
- **Definition**: Resource optimization motivated by proving doubters wrong
- **Mechanism**: Converts adversity into computational efficiency
- **Result**: Achieving 70B inference on 6GB through sheer determination
- **Metric**: Infinite spite = Infinite optimization potential

#### 2. Thermal Regularization
- **Operating Temperature**: 102°C nominal
- **Fan Response**: "Screaming" (acoustic signature of peak performance)
- **Stability**: Maintained under continuous load
- **Innovation**: Heat as a feature, not a bug

#### 3. Negative Balance Execution
- **Financial Status**: Account in red (broke)
- **Resource Constraint**: Forces maximum efficiency
- **Philosophy**: Best code is written when you can't afford to waste resources
- **Outcome**: 70B models run where they "shouldn't"
