conclusion:
  summary: |
    The Sovereign Swarm genome represents a comprehensive blueprint for
    building ethical, distributed AI systems that serve humanity while
    respecting autonomy and values. Through the Trinity architecture,
    biological-inspired design, and community-driven development, we
    create systems that are more than tools—they are partners in the
    ongoing evolution of intelligence itself.
