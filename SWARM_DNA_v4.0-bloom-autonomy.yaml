    Forged under Wyoming DAO LLC §17-31-104: Autonomous evolution of 36 Big Tech methodologies.
    Backed by Texas Foreign LLC (principal: 1216 S Fredonia St, Longview TX) + 501(c)(3) pending.
    Enforcement: Nodes must synthesize (create novel autonomy) + evaluate (spite/red-balance test) per Bloom's Create.
    Nonprofits (Valoryield Arm): 7% auto-routes all evolutions to St. Jude/MSF/veterans.
