PREAMBLE
===============================================================================

The Sovereignty Architecture ("Software") embodies a novel AI-governed 
charitable architecture with constitutional constraints and mandatory value 
routing to charitable causes. This license is designed to:

1. Preserve the 7% charitable routing mechanism as an architectural invariant
2. Prevent commercial exploitation that would remove charitable commitments
3. Enable research, education, and non-commercial use
4. Protect intellectual property while promoting beneficial applications
5. Ensure alignment-preserving mechanisms remain intact

This is NOT an open source license. This is a restrictive license designed
to protect a benevolent system from corruption while enabling non-commercial
beneficial use.
