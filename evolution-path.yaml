notes: |
  This evolution path represents a comprehensive roadmap from hobbyist
  home lab to enterprise-grade sovereign infrastructure. Each item is:
  
  1. Achievable with consumer hardware
  2. Independent of Big Tech services
  3. Scalable and maintainable
  4. Potentially monetizable
  5. Documented and reproducible
  
  The difficulty ratings (★☆☆ to ★★★★★) reflect:
  - Technical complexity
  - Time investment required
  - Prerequisites/dependencies
  - Domain knowledge needed
  
  Cost estimates are conservative and assume you already own:
  - Basic compute (Pi cluster or equivalent)
  - Storage (NAS or drives)
  - Networking equipment
  - Basic tools and cables
  
  Timeline estimates are for a single person working part-time.
  With a team or full-time focus, timelines compress significantly.
