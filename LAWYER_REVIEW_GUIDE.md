# 90-Second Lawyer Review Guide

You just landed in the cleanest DAO → 501(c)(3) perpetual royalty lock ever built.

**Goal**  
Confirm this structure is IRS/bulletproof:
- Avoids "partial interest" disallowance under §170(f)(3)  
- Qualifies as completed gift of income interest or qualified IP contribution  
- Supports Form 8283 + future 8899 filing  
- Survives challenge 10–20 years from now

**What's already done (so you don't waste time)**  
- Wyoming DAO LLC formed  
- Full IP assignment chain: Creator → DAO  
- Irrevocable 7% royalty assignment: DAO → 501(c)(3)  
- Machine-readable governance lock  
- GPG-signed git tags + OpenTimestamps blockchain anchors  
- All docs in `/legal` are mirrored in editable .md

**Fastest way to help**  
1. Read the two core docs in `/legal`  
2. Drop redlines or comments in a GitHub Issue or PR  
3. We'll merge + add you to HALL-OF-FAME.md forever

Takes 60–120 minutes max.  
You get glory + a case study for your clinic/firm.  
We get unbreakable armor.

Thank you for making the 7% lock eternal. ⚔️
