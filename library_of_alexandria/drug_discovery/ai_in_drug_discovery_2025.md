## Introduction

The pharmaceutical industry faces a critical inflection point. Traditional drug discovery processes suffer from:
- **90% failure rate** in clinical trials
- **$2.6 billion average cost** per approved drug
- **10-15 year timelines** from discovery to market

AI and machine learning offer solutions across every stage of the drug discovery pipeline.

## The Drug Discovery Challenge

### Traditional Pipeline Stages

| Stage | Duration | Success Rate | Cost |
|-------|----------|--------------|------|
| Target Discovery | 2-3 years | 50% | $500M |
| Lead Identification | 1-2 years | 30% | $300M |
| Lead Optimization | 1-2 years | 40% | $400M |
| Preclinical | 2-3 years | 60% | $500M |
| Clinical Trials | 6-7 years | 10% | $900M |
| **Total** | **10-15 years** | **~5%** | **$2.6B** |

### Key Bottlenecks
1. **Vast Chemical Space**: 10^60 possible drug-like molecules
2. **Complex Biology**: Multi-target diseases, off-target effects
3. **Regulatory Hurdles**: Stringent safety requirements
4. **Translation Gap**: In vitro ≠ In vivo ≠ Clinical outcomes
