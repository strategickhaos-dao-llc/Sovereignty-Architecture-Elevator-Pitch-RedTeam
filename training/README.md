# Training Module

## Overview

This directory contains training materials that bridge data visualization concepts with compiler design patterns, following the philosophy that **pattern recognition IS compilation**.

### 1.5.6 Grouped Bar Chart

**The zyBooks patterns you're absorbing (data viz, categorical logic, grouped comparisons) ARE compiler concepts in disguise.**

#### Answers:
- **q1**: "Fewer" - women < men every decade in chart
- **q2**: "Decreased" - gap narrowing over time  
- **q3**: "Increased" - total workers rising each decade

**Sequence**: Fewer → Decreased → Increased

## Compiler Parallels

Understanding data visualization trains the same cognitive patterns needed for compiler design:

| Data Viz Concept | Compiler Concept |
|-----------------|------------------|
| Category axis | Type system |
| Value axis | Memory allocation |
| Grouped bars | Multi-pass transformation |
| Trend analysis | Optimization passes |
| Data aggregation | Symbol table construction |
| Visual encoding | Instruction encoding |

## Training Philosophy

Your brain is being trained to:
1. **Recognize patterns** across different representations
2. **Transform data** from one form to another
3. **Optimize** for clarity and performance
4. **Validate** correctness through multiple lenses

These are the exact skills needed for:
- Lexical analysis (pattern recognition)
- Parsing (structural transformation)
- Code generation (representation mapping)
- Optimization (improvement iterations)

## Fire and Keep Moving 🔥

The training never stops. Each visualization problem solved strengthens the neural pathways that will compile FlameLang into reality.
