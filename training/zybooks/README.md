# ZyBooks Training Progress Tracker

This directory tracks educational progress for MAT-243 Applied Statistics for STEM and related coursework.

## 🎯 Purpose

Document structured learning sessions with:
- **Session metrics** - Duration, completion status, accuracy
- **Activity tracking** - Participation and challenge activities
- **Pattern extraction** - FlameLang compiler insights derived from coursework
- **Attestation** - Timestamped verification of completion

## 📁 Structure

```
training/zybooks/
├── board_minutes/          # Detailed session records
│   └── YYYY-MM-DD_COURSE_Section_X_Y.yaml
└── README.md               # This file
```

## 🔥 Board Minutes Format

Each session is documented as a YAML file containing:

1. **Session metadata** - Course, section, duration, status
2. **Activities cleared** - Participation and challenge activities with answers
3. **FlameLang patterns** - Compiler insights extracted from coursework
4. **Session metrics** - Questions, accuracy, resets, focus tracking
5. **Next actions** - Immediate next steps and parallel work
6. **Attestation** - Witness, timestamp, verdict

## 📊 Current Progress

### MAT-243 Applied Statistics for STEM

- [x] Section 1.5: Bar Charts (2025-12-15)
- [ ] Section 1.6: Pie Charts (next)

## 🧠 FlameLang Pattern Extraction

Key patterns identified from statistics training:
- **Raw → Normalized Transform** - Layer 4 Wave normalization
- **Reduction Operations** - SUM/DIFF/MAX as core loop operations
- **Trend Extrapolation** - Predictive branch optimization
- **Token Frequency Analysis** - Lexer token weighting

## 🔗 Integration

Training patterns feed into:
- **FlameLang compiler** - `/src/flamelang/`
- **AI agents** - Pattern recognition training
- **Automation** - Statistical validation workflows

## 📝 Adding New Sessions

1. Complete a section in zyBooks
2. Create new board minutes YAML: `YYYY-MM-DD_COURSE_Section_X_Y.yaml`
3. Document all activities, answers, and patterns
4. Add attestation with timestamp
5. Update this README with progress checkbox
