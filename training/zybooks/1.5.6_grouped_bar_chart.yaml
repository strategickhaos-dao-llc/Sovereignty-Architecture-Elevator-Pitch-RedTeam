    concept: "Data visualization categorical logic mapped to compiler concepts"
    mappings:
      category_axis: "type system"
      value_axis: "memory allocation"
      grouped_bars: "multi-pass transformation"
  
  questions_and_answers:
    q1:
      question: "Comparing women to men across decades"
      answer: "Fewer"
      explanation: "women < men every decade in chart"
      
    q2:
      question: "Gender gap trend over time"
      answer: "Decreased"
      explanation: "gap narrowing over time"
      
    q3:
      question: "Total workers trend"
      answer: "Increased"
      explanation: "total workers rising each decade"
  
  sequence: "Fewer → Decreased → Increased"
  
  compiler_parallels:
    - "Category axis = type system (classifying data into discrete types)"
    - "Value axis = memory allocation (quantifying resources)"
    - "Grouped bars = multi-pass transformation (parallel data streams)"
    - "Trend analysis = optimization passes (improving over iterations)"
