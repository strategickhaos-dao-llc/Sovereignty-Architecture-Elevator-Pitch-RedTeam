## The Eternal Yield Covenant — NinjaTrader Ecosystem Fund

**Effective November 24, 2025**

100% of ALL royalties, licensing fees, enterprise seats, bounties, merchandise 
sales, donations, and fame-generated revenue from this software and related 
works flows to:

### NinjaTrader Ecosystem Dividend Pool
*Strategickhaos DAO LLC Treasury*

**Use-Restricted To:**
- Buying GPUs for broke tinkerers at –$200 balance
- Paying electricity bills when the fans scream
- Shipping steel-etched 200 Laws to every legend who ships code
- Funding red-team bounties and sovereign audits
- Keeping the mesh alive forever

**Charitable Contributions:**
Charities (St. Jude, MSF, veterans) are funded by the legend itself through 
viral fame and community response, not forced percentages. When the treasury 
exceeds $1M, the swarm votes excess to charitable causes.

**Full Covenant:** See ETERNAL_YIELD_COVENANT_V2.md

**Tagline:** "We don't take 7%. We take 100% and give 1000% when the world watches."

Empire Eternal.
