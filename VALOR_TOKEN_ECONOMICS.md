## 📋 Overview

The $VALOR token serves as the governance and distribution mechanism for the DiviDen Refinery ecosystem, connecting DAO members to the passive income streams generated by:
- Ninja Dividend Capture Bots
- Royalty/Reparation Refineries
- Nonprofit Foundation Distributions

## 🎯 Token Purpose

### Governance
- Voting on DAO proposals
- Strategy parameter adjustments
- Charity allocation decisions
- Emergency governance actions

### Distribution
- Pro-rata share of refinery output
- Tax-advantaged distributions through nonprofit layer
- Proof-of-resonance verification

### Staking
- Required for participation in distributions
- Longer staking = higher multiplier
- Contributes to ecosystem stability

```

### Distribution Formula

```
holder_share = (staked_valor / total_staked) × duration_multiplier × distribution_pool
```

Where:
- `staked_valor`: Amount of $VALOR staked by holder
- `total_staked`: Total $VALOR staked across all holders
- `duration_multiplier`: Bonus based on stake duration (see below)
- `distribution_pool`: 63% of refinery revenue

### Duration Multipliers

| Stake Duration | Multiplier |
|----------------|------------|
| < 30 days      | 1.0x       |
| 30-90 days     | 1.1x       |
| 90-180 days    | 1.25x      |
| 180-365 days   | 1.5x       |
| > 365 days     | 2.0x       |

  snapshot_timing: "block_at_proposal_creation"
```

### Proposal Types

## 💰 Staking Mechanics

### Staking Requirements

```yaml
staking:
  minimum_stake: 100           # 100 VALOR minimum
  maximum_stake: unlimited
  
  lock_periods:
    flexible: 0_days           # No bonus, can unstake anytime
    short_term: 30_days        # 1.1x bonus
    medium_term: 90_days       # 1.25x bonus  
    long_term: 180_days        # 1.5x bonus
    committed: 365_days        # 2.0x bonus
    
  early_unstake_penalty:
    flexible: 0%
    locked: 10%                # Applied to rewards, not principal
```

### Staking Rewards

In addition to distribution share:
- Base APY from staking rewards pool (15M tokens over 10 years)
- Bonus multipliers for longer commitment
- Compounding options available

### Proof-of-Resonance

Staking demonstrates "resonance" with the ecosystem's mission:
- Long-term stakers are more aligned with charitable goals
- Higher multipliers reward commitment to positive outcomes
- Creates sustainable, mission-driven community

## 🔐 Security Measures

### Smart Contract Security

```yaml
security:
  audits:
    - firm: "[To be determined]"
      status: "planned"
    
  mechanisms:
    - multi_sig_treasury: "3-of-5"
    - timelock_delay: 48_hours
    - emergency_pause: enabled
    - upgrade_pattern: "transparent_proxy"
    
  bug_bounty:
    enabled: true
    max_payout: 100000        # USD equivalent
```

### Economic Security

- Gradual distribution prevents concentration
- Lock periods reduce volatility
- Treasury diversification for stability
- Emergency pause capabilities

## 📈 Value Drivers

### Intrinsic Value

1. **Revenue Share**: Direct claim on refinery output
2. **Governance Rights**: Control over strategy and allocations
3. **Scarcity**: Fixed supply with deflationary pressure from burns

### Utility Value

1. **Staking Rewards**: Passive income from token holdings
2. **Distribution Access**: Required for refinery distributions
3. **Ecosystem Access**: Premium features and early access

### Social Value

1. **Charitable Impact**: Every token supports verified charities
2. **Justice Funding**: Supports pro bono legal actions
3. **Community Building**: Aligned incentives for positive outcomes

## ⚖️ Compliance Considerations

### Regulatory Framework

- Token designed as governance/utility token
- Not designed to represent investment contract
- No profit expectations from efforts of others
- Utility within closed ecosystem

### Tax Considerations

- Distributions may be taxable income
- Consult tax professional for your jurisdiction
- Foundation structure provides certain advantages
- Proper reporting is participant responsibility

### Legal Structure

- Token issued by DAO LLC
- Foundation handles distributions
- Clear separation of roles
