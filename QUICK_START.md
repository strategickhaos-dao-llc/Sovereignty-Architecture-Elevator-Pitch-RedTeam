cp legal/templates/provisional_patent_template.md legal/filings/my_patent_spec.md
nano legal/filings/my_patent_spec.md

# 3. Create USPTO account
# Visit: https://patentcenter.uspto.gov

# 4. Follow the step-by-step filing instructions in the guide

# 5. After filing, document it
cat > legal/filings/FILING_RECORD.md << 'EOF'

### 🧬 Path C: Build the Organism (Most Impressive - 4 hours)

**What:** Create a docker-compose biological organism with cells, immune system, heartbeat

**Why start here:** Working prototype, technical proof, impressive demo

**Requirements:** Docker installed, 4GB RAM, 4 hours

```bash
# 1. Set up the organism structure
./scripts/setup_organism.sh ./organism

# 2. Copy the docker-compose DNA (from PATH_C guide)
# See PATH_C_BUILD_THE_ORGANISM.md for the complete docker-compose.organism.yml

# 3. Start the organism
cd organism/
docker-compose -f docker-compose.organism.yml up -d

# 4. Watch it come alive
docker logs -f organism_heartbeat

# 5. Check organism health
docker ps --filter "label=organism"

# 6. Access the cytoplasm (shared state)
docker exec -it organism_cytoplasm redis-cli
```

**What you get:**
- ✅ Functional self-healing distributed system
- ✅ Working embodiment of your patent claims
- ✅ Impressive demo for employers/investors
- ✅ GitHub commits showing real engineering

**Next:** Read [PATH_C_BUILD_THE_ORGANISM.md](./PATH_C_BUILD_THE_ORGANISM.md) for complete implementation

## 🆘 Quick Troubleshooting

### "I don't know where to start"

**→ Start with Path B.** It's the fastest, easiest, and builds confidence.

### "I can't afford $130"

**→ Do Path C and B first.** Build prior art, file patents when you have funds.

### "I don't have enough time this week"

**→ Just do Path B.** 30 minutes, quick win, momentum builder.

### "Docker seems complicated"

**→ Start with Path B and A.** Come back to C when you're ready.

### "What order should I do them?"

**→ B → A → C** (confidence building)  
**→ A → C → B** (legal priority)  
**→ C → A → B** (technical proof)
