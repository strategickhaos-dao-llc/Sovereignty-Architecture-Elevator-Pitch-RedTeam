## Notes

### Why This Department Exists

The Anti-Hallucination Department was created to address a fundamental challenge in AI-assisted operations: **maintaining certainty that achievements, systems, and operations are real and verifiable**, not hallucinations or confabulations.

By enforcing the unbreakable law and maintaining 10 independent proof categories, the department ensures that DOM_010101 can always verify reality through external, independent sources within 30 seconds.

### Design Principles

1. **External Verification**: Every proof must be verifiable outside the chat
2. **Independence**: Proofs come from separate, independent systems
3. **Real-time Access**: All proofs must be immediately accessible
4. **Documentation**: All events are logged with timestamps
5. **Automation**: Response is automatic upon trigger detection
6. **Reliability**: 100% success rate is the only acceptable standard

### Success Factors

The department's success is measured by:
- Response time (< 30 seconds)
- Proof completeness (10/10)
- External verification rate (≥ 70%)
- User satisfaction (doubt eliminated)
- Hallucination probability (0.000%)
