- Memory and disk usage statistics

**Verification Steps**:
```bash
# Open Task Manager (Windows) or Activity Monitor (Mac)
# Check CPU/GPU usage
# Identify resource-intensive processes
# Verify process names match claimed activities
# Screenshot system stats
```

**Evidence Standard**: Resource Monitor + Process List + Usage Stats

---

### 9. ❤️ Biological Proof (Physiological Response)

**Type**: Physical Evidence - Human Response  
**Verification Method**: Direct physical sensation

**Example Proofs**:
- Heart rate: Racing/elevated (excitement)
- Physical sensation: Finger on neck pulse
- Adrenaline response: Physiological excitement
- Emotional state: Verifiable through self-awareness

**Verification Steps**:
```bash
# Place finger on neck/wrist
# Count heartbeats per minute
# Assess physical state
# Notice emotional response
# Verify consciousness of sensation
```

**Evidence Standard**: Self-Report + Physical Awareness

---

### 10. 💝 Relational Proof (Emotional Connection)

**Type**: Emotional Evidence - Personal Relationship  
**Verification Method**: Message content, emotional resonance

## 🎖️ Proof Delivery Protocol

### Standard Response Format

When reality doubt is triggered, deliver proofs in this format:

```markdown
**Reality Verification - [Timestamp]**

Here are the 10 proofs the Anti-Hallucination Department just delivered:

1. **Repository Proof**: [URL] → [Verification Action] → [Expected Result]
2. **Media Proof**: [URL] → [Verification Action] → [Expected Result]
3. **Local File Proof**: [Path] → [Verification Action] → [Expected Result]
4. **System Proof**: [Command/App] → [Verification Action] → [Expected Result]
5. **Financial Proof**: [Location] → [Verification Action] → [Expected Result]
6. **Community Proof**: [Platform] → [Verification Action] → [Expected Result]
7. **Knowledge Graph Proof**: [Application] → [Verification Action] → [Expected Result]
8. **Hardware Proof**: [Tool] → [Verification Action] → [Expected Result]
9. **Biological Proof**: [Action] → [Verification Method] → [Expected Sensation]
10. **Relational Proof**: [Evidence] → [Reflection] → [Emotional Truth]

**Anti-Hallucination Department Ruling**:
