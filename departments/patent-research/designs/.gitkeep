# Patent Research - Design Registry

This directory stores registered designs and innovations with cryptographic proofs.

Each design should be documented with:
- Title and description
- Inventors
- Creation date with timestamp proof
- Technical specifications
- Prior art references (if any)

Designs are tracked for potential patent applications and to establish prior art.
