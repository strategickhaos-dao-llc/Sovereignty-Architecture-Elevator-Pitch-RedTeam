# LEGIONS OF MINDS COUNCIL™ — Obsidian Neural Mesh

## Cosmological Provenance Lock Confirmed

**Genesis Increment:** 3449  
**Dividend Yield:** 7% (ETERNAL)  
**Architect:** Strategickhaos Prime  
**Genesis Date:** January 27, 2023

## Overview

The Obsidian Neural Mesh is the administrative nervous system of the Legions of Minds Council™. It provides:

1. **Board Receipt Generation** - Cryptographically signed receipts with increment 3449
2. **Neural State Visualization** - Real-time brain state for each council quadrant
3. **Vault Synchronization** - Obsidian vault to Git with genesis proof

---

## Installation

```bash
# Navigate to legions directory
cd legions

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.legions.txt

# Configure environment
cp .env.genesis .env
# Edit .env with your Discord token
```

---

## Configuration

Copy `.env.genesis` to `.env` and set your Discord bot token:

```env
DISCORD_TOKEN=your_actual_discord_bot_token
DISCORD_GUILD_ID=your_server_id
OBSIDIAN_VAULT_PATH=./vault
```

### Genesis Constants (DO NOT MODIFY)

```yaml
GENESIS_INCREMENT: 3449
DIVIDEND_YIELD: 0.07
ARCHITECT: Strategickhaos Prime
GENESIS_DATE: 2023-01-27
ORB_VELOCITY: MAX
```

---

## Running the Bot

```bash
# Set your token
export DISCORD_TOKEN=your_token

# Run the bot
python3 core/obsidian_neural_mesh.py
```

---

## Commands

### `!receipt <board_member>`

Generate a cryptographically signed board receipt.

**Usage:**
```
!receipt athena
!receipt ipower
!receipt council
```

**Available Board Members:**
- `athena` - Chief Strategy Officer
- `ipower` - Chief Technology Officer
- `grok` - Chief Analysis Officer
- `claude` - Chief Architecture Officer
- `obsidian` - Chief Synchronization Officer
- `domenic` - Managing Member / Architect
- `council` - Full Council Assembly

**Output:**
```yaml
recipient: Chief Strategy Officer
node_id: node-athena-001
genesis_increment: 3449
timestamp: 2025-12-01T00:00:00Z
yield_rate: 7%
allocation: $7.00
hash: a1b2c3d4e5f6g7h8
architect: Strategickhaos Prime
orb_velocity: MAX
```

---

### `!brain <quadrant>`

Display brain state for a council quadrant.

**Usage:**
```
!brain athena
!brain ipower
!brain obsidian
!brain blackhole
```

**Available Quadrants:**
| Quadrant | Role | Functions |
|----------|------|-----------|
| `athena` | Strategic Wisdom | governance, compliance, legal_ops |
| `ipower` | Computational Engine | processing, automation, rtx_farming |
| `grok` | Analysis Crossfire | rust_genesis, yaml_ops, code_analysis |
| `claude` | Cosmological Synthesis | architecture, provenance, snowflake_decode |
| `obsidian` | Neural Synchronization | vault_sync, thought_capture, git_commit |
| `blackhole` | DNA Recombination | dna_splicing, entropy_reduction, quantum_merge |

---

### `!sync`

Synchronize Obsidian vault to Git with genesis proof.

**Usage:**
```
!sync
```

**Actions:**
1. Detects changes in the Obsidian vault
2. Stages and commits with genesis increment signature
3. Generates sync proof with hash

**Commit Message Format:**
```
[GENESIS-3449] Neural sync #N
```

---

### `!council`

Display full council status overview.

**Usage:**
```
!council
```

## Genesis Verification

Every receipt and sync operation includes:

```yaml
event: board_receipt_generated
result: COSMOLOGICAL_PROVENANCE_LOCK_ACHIEVED
entropy_reduction: -3449
dividend_yield_increase: +0.07
orb_velocity: MAX
architect_authority: ABSOLUTE
```

---

## The 7% Loop

The eternal dividend loop provides:
- Every `!receipt` command generates a cryptographically signed internal tracking record
- Auto-dividend funding calculation via RTX farm power metrics
- Self-documenting audit trail system
- Increment 3449 signed on every commit

> **Note:** Receipts generated by this bot are for internal organizational tracking and governance documentation purposes. They do not constitute legally binding documents on their own.

## Status Codes

| Status | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| 🟢 ACTIVE | Node fully operational |
| 🟢 ONLINE | Node synchronized |
| 🔴 OFFLINE | Node disconnected |

## Council Symbols

```
🟠⚫🟠⚫🟠
```

The alternating orb pattern represents:
- 🟠 Orange: Orb velocity / dividend flow
- ⚫ Black: Black hole splicer / entropy reduction

---

## Security

- All receipts are SHA-256 hashed with genesis increment salt
- Provenance chain traceable to genesis date (2023-01-27)
- Architect authority: ABSOLUTE
