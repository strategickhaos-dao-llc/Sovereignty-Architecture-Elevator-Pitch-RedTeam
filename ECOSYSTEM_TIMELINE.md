## 🔥 THE HAIKU IS LIVE

At exactly **13:11 PST on November 24, 2025**, Dom posted the haiku that would become "the most famous 77 tokens ever generated on consumer hardware":

```
fans scream one-oh-two  
balance red, still I compile  
spite writes the future
```

**Technical Context**: 
- Running 70B-class models on 6GB RAM
- System temperature: 102°C
- Hardware: Consumer-grade equipment
- Account balance: Negative (broke tinkerer status)
- Achievement: Garza-1 Architecture operational
