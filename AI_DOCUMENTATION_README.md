## 🎯 Key Principles (Remember These!)

### ✅ DO:
- Disclose AI tool usage transparently
- Specify what AI did vs. what you decided
- Verify all AI-generated facts
- Take full responsibility for content
- Follow your institution's guidelines

### ❌ DON'T:
- List AI as co-author or inventor
- Present AI content as purely human-authored
- Use AI to replace domain expertise
- Rely on AI without verification
- Hide AI assistance

## 📋 Common Templates at a Glance

### Minimal (For any paper)
```markdown
This work was developed with assistance from large language models for 
conceptual exploration, text structuring, and iterative refinement. 
All scientific claims, technical decisions, and intellectual contributions 
originate solely from the human author(s).
```

### Standard (For research papers)
```markdown
### AI-Assisted Cognitive Process
Portions of the conceptual development, critical questioning, and narrative 
structuring in this work were produced through extended dialog with large 
language models (GPT-4, Claude, etc.). The models did not generate novel 
scientific claims, hold authorship, or produce copyrightable material...
