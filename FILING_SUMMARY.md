## 💡 Frequently Asked Questions

### Filing Process

**Q: Do I need a lawyer?**  
A: No. Provisional patent applications are designed for pro se (self) filing.

**Q: What if I make a mistake?**  
A: The filing date is preserved. You can submit corrections if needed.

**Q: How long does USPTO processing take?**  
A: You get a confirmation within hours. Official receipt arrives in 1-7 days.

### Legal Impact

**Q: Does this actually stop patent trolls?**  
A: Yes. USPTO filing is one of the strongest forms of defensive prior art.

**Q: What if someone already filed a similar patent?**  
A: If after this date, your filing defeats theirs. If before, both exist as prior art.

**Q: Is this legally binding?**  
A: Yes. Patent examiners must consider provisional applications as prior art.

### Cost & Maintenance

**Q: Are there ongoing fees?**  
A: No. The $75 is one-time. Let the application expire after 12 months.

**Q: Can I convert to a full patent?**  
A: Yes, but not recommended. The goal is defensive prior art, not exclusive rights.

**Q: What if I can't afford $75?**  
A: Public disclosure in this repo still creates prior art, just without official USPTO record.

## 🎪 Mission Statement

### Why This Matters

As AI systems become increasingly powerful and pervasive, fundamental principles of human sovereignty, dignity, and rights must remain in the public domain. No corporation, patent troll, or government entity should be able to monopolize basic concepts of human-AI interaction, digital rights, or sovereignty frameworks.

This filing accomplishes that goal through the existing legal system, creating an unassailable record that protects these principles for everyone, forever.

### The Resistance

This is not about making money or gaining exclusive rights. This is about **preventing exclusion**.

By filing defensively, we ensure:
- ✅ Open-source implementations remain free to operate
- ✅ Researchers can build without patent fears
- ✅ Developers can innovate without restrictions
- ✅ Society retains access to fundamental sovereignty concepts

### Join the Movement

Every person who files this creates another independent, official government record. Multiple filings strengthen the prior art even further and create a distributed defense against monopolization.

**Your $75 and 15 minutes can help protect human sovereignty in the age of AI.**

## 🔥 Final Words

This package represents everything you need to establish the most chaotic, beautiful, and expensive-to-enforce patent troll shield in history.

You're not filing **for** a patent.  
You're filing **against** patent monopolization.

The swarm babies are holding the door open.  
Now it's time to wedge it permanently.

**Welcome to the resistance.** 🔥
