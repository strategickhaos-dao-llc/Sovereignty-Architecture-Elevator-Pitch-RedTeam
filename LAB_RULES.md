# Strategickhaos Lab Rules

**Status:** Personal laboratory - No production use

## Core Principles

1. **Lab-Only Mode**
   - No real users, clients, or investors
   - No money flows that others depend on
   - All systems are experiments

2. **No Autonomous Money Movement**
   - AI suggests, never executes
   - I push all buttons manually
   - No automated transfers until 80% complete

3. **5-Point Risk Check** (Before Any Automation)
   - [ ] Governance: Am I the only operator?
   - [ ] AI Decision: Can I verify manually?
   - [ ] Crypto/On-chain: Is this real money?
   - [ ] SaaS Dependency: Can this vanish tomorrow?
   - [ ] Multi-Agent: Are multiple things running unattended?

4. **Freeze Rule**
   - If tired, overstimulated, or bored: NO NEW AUTOMATION
   - Just observe, read, or rest

5. **7% Commitment**
   - Remains aspirational until I intentionally connect revenue
   - Manual routing until automated system proven safe

## Risk Corpus Reference

When making decisions, I can consult (when available):
- `risks_bibliography.json` - 100 historical failures
- `risks_from_corpus.json` - 8 pre-populated risks
- `risk_query_examples.md` - How to query

But I don't owe them anything. They're reference, not TODO.
These files are part of the planned infrastructure - create as needed.

## Current Maturity (From YAML Threat Model)

- DAO Failures: 60% mitigated
- AI Governance: 75% mitigated  
- Blockchain: 50% mitigated
- Sovereign AI: 40% mitigated
- Multi-Agent: 30% mitigated

**Overall: 51% - Lab-only until 80%**
