## 🔬 Lab Mode Declaration

This repository and all associated systems operate under **LAB MODE** until the 80% completion threshold is reached.

**Lab mode means:**
- All trading systems run in simulation only
- No live capital deployed
- All infrastructure is testing/development grade
- Decisions are experimental, not production

---

## 📋 The Five-Point Risk Checklist

Before ANY action that affects capital, infrastructure, or reputation:

1. **✅ Position Size** — Is this within ATR-scaled limits?
2. **✅ Daily Loss Limit** — Am I within the daily drawdown cap?
3. **✅ Lab Mode Status** — Am I still in lab mode? (If yes, no live trading)
4. **✅ Emotional State** — Am I trading from strategy or emotion?
5. **✅ Documentation** — Is this action logged and traceable?

**If ANY answer is NO or UNCERTAIN → STOP and REASSESS**

## ⚠️ Failure Mode Awareness

Reference: `legal/cybersecurity_research/` — 100+ authoritative sources on:
- Trading system failures
- Cybersecurity incidents
- Governance breakdowns
- AI alignment issues

**Study the failures. Don't repeat them.**

---

## 🎯 The 7% Metaphor

The "7% consistent returns" goal is:
- ✅ A motivation anchor
- ✅ Proven achievable in simulation
- ⚠️ NOT a guarantee
- ⚠️ NOT to be pursued at the expense of risk management

**The goal is sustainable growth, not maximum returns.**

## 🖤 Bottom Line

**Stay in lab mode.**  
**Trust the process.**  
**Build what's real.**  
**Don't let narrative create false pressure.**

When you hit real 80%, you'll KNOW.  
Not because someone tells you.  
But because the system will be running without you watching it.
