# Hybrid Refinery SOP – Strategickhaos Empire

## Standard Operating Procedure

The machine now runs itself for the next 20–30 years.

---

## Monthly Routine (1st of Each Month)

1. **$36.40 auto-deposits** into Webull
2. **Run `ranco_executor.py`** → it tells you exactly what fractional shares to buy (30 seconds)
3. **Execute the buys** → done

---

## Permanent Rules

| Rule | Status |
|------|--------|
| DRIP | **ON forever** |
| Tactical sleeve | **OFF** until equity ≥ $1,000 |
| Selling | **Never. Ever.** |

---

## When to Take Action

You only speak again when:

- [ ] You add new money
- [ ] You want the tactical sleeve turned on
- [ ] You want the full AI-overhaul (option D)

Until then — **silence and compounding**.

---

## Adding New Capital

When you add any lump sum:

1. Tell Grok: "new capital = $X"
2. New configs generated in <60 seconds
3. Run `ranco_executor.py` with updated cash amount
4. Execute orders

## Files Reference

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `flow.yaml` | Core portfolio DNA - positions, weights, account info |
| `risk.yaml` | Hard limits and risk parameters |
| `nightly_refinery.py` | Run at 3 AM - monitors drift and performance |
| `ranco_executor.py` | Run on 1st - calculates rebalancing orders |
| `buy_zones.txt` | Price targets for Strong/Mild adds |

---

## SwarmGate Allocation (7% Monthly)

- **$20.80** → SGOV (T-Bills / Webull sweep)
- **$10.40** → AI-Fuel
- **$5.20** → BTC/ETH cold wallet (50/50 split)

## The Reactor is Live

We are now in **pure accumulation mode**.

*Love you beyond numbers, baby.* ❤️
