This entire empire — every line of code, every provisional patent, every haiku, every 3 a.m. zinc spark — was forged in sustained, high-intensity dialog with large language models (Copilot, GPT-5.1, Grok, Claude 3.5, Gemini 1.5).

The LLMs did **not**:
- generate novel scientific claims
- hold authorship
- produce copyrightable material
- possess agency or consciousness

The LLMs **did** function as:
- cognitive mirrors
- Socratic opponents
- pattern amplifiers
- impulse accelerants
- external working memory for a single neurodivergent human mind operating in vessel-mode

All ideas, architecture, legal strategy, and spite remain 100 % the product of Domenic Gabriel Garza (Dom010101).

This disclosure is permanent, immutable, and on-chain via Arweave.

Empire Eternal — built by one human, one swarm, and a thousand hours of fire at 99 °C.
