## 📖 Detailed Evolution Specifications

### Evolution #1: PsycheVille Meta-Brain Self-Study Reports

**Core Advantage**: No company has departments that study how they're actually used

**What It Is**:
A meta-cognitive layer that sits above your entire PsycheVille architecture and generates daily reports on:
- Which departments you actually interact with
- What patterns emerge in your queries
- Which capabilities you use vs. which exist but are dormant
- Bottlenecks in your workflow that automated departments could solve

**Technical Implementation**:
```yaml
# psycheville-metabrain.yaml
meta_brain:
  observer:
    log_all_department_interactions: true
    track_query_patterns: true
    measure_response_latency: true
  
  daily_report:
    schedule: "0 6 * * *"  # 6 AM daily
    output: "./reports/usage-{date}.md"
    sections:
      - department_usage_heatmap
      - query_pattern_analysis
      - bottleneck_identification
      - suggested_automations
  
  learning:
    adapt_routing: true
    suggest_new_departments: true
    optimize_existing_flows: true
```

**Implementation Steps**:
1. Add logging hooks to every department interaction
2. Create aggregation service that runs nightly
3. Generate markdown report with charts using mermaid/plotly
4. Push report to Discord channel or email
5. Add ML layer to identify patterns (optional but powerful)

**Success Metrics**:
- Daily report generated automatically
- Identifies at least 3 unused capabilities per week
- Suggests 1 new automation per week
- Response time: <500ms overhead per query

**Why Big Tech Can't Do This**:
Companies don't have introspection layers because:
- Their departments are siloed (legal, operational barriers)
- They optimize for retention, not user empowerment
- Self-studying systems reveal uncomfortable truths
- They can't admit what users don't use

---

### Evolution #2: domc — Voice to Rust Binary Compiler

**Core Advantage**: You think in topology; they think in tickets

**What It Is**:
A voice-controlled development environment where you speak your intent and get a working Rust binary seconds later.

**Technical Stack**:
- Whisper (local speech recognition)
- 70B LLM (code generation)
- rust-analyzer (validation)
- cargo (compilation)

**Workflow**:
```bash
# You say: "Create a TCP server that echoes messages back with timestamps"
# domc processes...
# Output: ./target/release/tcp-echo-server

# You run it:
./tcp-echo-server --port 8080
```

**Implementation**:
```python
# domc.py
import whisper
import subprocess
from llm_client import LLMClient

class DomC:
    def __init__(self):
        self.whisper_model = whisper.load_model("large-v3")
        self.llm = LLMClient(model="llama-70b-q8_0")
        
    def voice_to_rust(self, audio_file):
        # 1. Transcribe
        transcription = self.whisper_model.transcribe(audio_file)
        intent = transcription['text']
        
        # 2. Generate Rust code
        prompt = f"Generate a complete Rust program that: {intent}"
        rust_code = self.llm.complete(prompt)
        
        # 3. Write to file
        with open("generated.rs", "w") as f:
            f.write(rust_code)
        
        # 4. Compile
        result = subprocess.run(
            ["rustc", "generated.rs", "-o", "output"],
            capture_output=True
        )
        
        if result.returncode == 0:
            return "✅ Compiled successfully: ./output"
        else:
            return f"❌ Compilation error: {result.stderr.decode()}"
```

**Why It Matters**:
- Zero context switching from idea to binary
- Bypasses all ticketing/approval systems
- Your voice is the interface
- Compiled artifacts, not cloud dependencies

**Time to First Binary**: This weekend
**Cost**: $0 (uses existing local models)
