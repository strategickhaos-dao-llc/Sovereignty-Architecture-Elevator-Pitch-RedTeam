## 🏆 Why This Works

### Built on Real Infrastructure

This isn't theoretical. The framework is battle-tested on:
- 4-node Kubernetes cluster
- Local LLM swarm (Ollama + multiple models)
- Grafana/Prometheus observability stack
- GitHub MCP for evidence timestamping
- Production workloads and red team testing

### Patent-Backed Framework

The 100-point safety framework is:
- Derived from real implementations (not just OWASP lists)
- Documented for patent applications
- Updated based on emerging threats
- Used in multiple client engagements

### Compliance-Ready Output

Everything is documented for:
- GDPR, CCPA, HIPAA (where applicable)
- SOC 2 Type II audits
- ISO 27001 certification
- Patent applications
- Investor due diligence
- Legal risk assessment

---

## 🚀 Who This Is For

### ✅ Perfect Fit

- **Seed → Series A startups** building LLM features
- **Small AI teams** (5-50 people) needing security credibility
- **Founders** asked "What's your LLM safety story?" by investors
- **CTOs/VPs Eng** preparing for compliance audits
- **Product teams** adding LLM features to existing products

### ⚠️ Not a Fit (Yet)

- Enterprise companies (50M+ revenue) - you need Big 4 consulting
- Companies with no LLM features or plans to add them
- Pre-MVP stage with no users or production deployment
- Teams looking for generic security advice (not LLM-specific)
