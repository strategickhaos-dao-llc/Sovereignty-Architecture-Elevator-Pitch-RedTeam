# Session 07: SwarmGate Treasury + Cognitive Gates Automation

## Status
📋 **Planned** - 0%

## Session Goals
- [ ] Design SwarmGate treasury architecture
- [ ] Create cognitive gates for economic sovereignty
- [ ] Implement automated treasury management
- [ ] Build token economics model

## Overview

This session will develop **SwarmGate**—an autonomous treasury system with cognitive gates that manage economic resources based on dialectical decision-making. The treasury will enable true economic sovereignty for the DAO.

## Key Contradictions to Address

1. **Centralized vs Decentralized Control**: Treasury needs security but shouldn't have single points of failure
   - **Proposed Resolution**: Multi-sig with cognitive gate automation
   - **Target Implementation**: SwarmGate with distributed decision-making

2. **Automation vs Human Oversight**: Want efficiency but need human judgment for critical decisions
   - **Proposed Resolution**: Cognitive gates with escalation thresholds
   - **Target Implementation**: Automated small decisions, human approval for large

3. **Transparency vs Privacy**: DAO needs transparency but protect operational details
   - **Proposed Resolution**: Zero-knowledge proofs for privacy-preserving transparency
   - **Target Implementation**: ZK-enabled treasury reporting

## Architectural Concepts

### SwarmGate Components

1. **Treasury Vault**
   - Multi-sig wallet integration
   - Asset diversification management
   - Automated reserve management
   - Emergency circuit breakers

2. **Cognitive Gates**
   - Decision automation framework
   - Threshold-based escalation
   - Dialectical reasoning for economics
   - Risk assessment engines

3. **Token Economics**
   - Utility token design
   - Governance token mechanics
   - Staking and rewards
   - Treasury sustainability model

4. **Automation Engine**
   - Recurring payment automation
   - Revenue distribution
   - Investment rebalancing
   - Compliance reporting

### Existing Foundation

- `/dao_record.yaml` - DAO governance structure
- `/dao_record_v1.0.yaml` - Current DAO configuration
- `/governance/` - Governance framework (to be created)
- Vault integration from Session 03

## Dependencies

### Requires from Previous Sessions
- Session 01: Sovereignty principles for economic control
- Session 03: Security hardening for treasury protection
- Session 05: K8s deployment for SwarmGate services
- Session 06: Dialectical engine for decision-making

### Enables Future Sessions
- Session 11: DAO governance depends on treasury infrastructure
- Session 12: Production system needs economic sustainability

## Proposed Artifacts

### Smart Contracts (To Be Developed)
- `SwarmGateTreasury.sol` - Main treasury contract
- `CognitiveGate.sol` - Decision automation logic
- `GovernanceToken.sol` - DAO governance token
- `MultiSigManager.sol` - Multi-sig orchestration

### Backend Services
- `treasury_manager.py` - Treasury operations service
- `cognitive_gate_engine.py` - Decision automation
- `economics_simulator.py` - Token economics testing
- `compliance_reporter.py` - Regulatory reporting

### Documentation (To Be Created)
- `SWARMGATE_ARCHITECTURE.md` - Technical specification
- `TOKEN_ECONOMICS.md` - Economic model documentation
- `TREASURY_OPERATIONS.md` - Operations runbook
- `COGNITIVE_GATES.md` - Decision automation guide

## Economic Model Concepts

### Revenue Sources
1. **Service Fees**: Infrastructure usage fees
2. **Sovereignty Premium**: Export/migration services
3. **Licensing**: GitRiders and sovereignty stack licenses
4. **Consulting**: Implementation and integration services

### Treasury Allocation
- **40% Operating Reserve**: 6-12 months runway
- **30% Growth Investment**: R&D and expansion
- **20% Member Rewards**: Contributor incentives
- **10% Security Fund**: Emergency and insurance

### Cognitive Gate Thresholds
- **< $1,000**: Fully automated
- **$1,000 - $10,000**: Single approver required
- **$10,000 - $100,000**: Multi-sig 2-of-3
- **> $100,000**: Multi-sig 3-of-5 + 48hr timelock

## Research Questions

1. How to balance automation with human oversight in treasury management?
2. What token economics model ensures long-term sustainability?
3. How to implement cognitive gates that improve with dialectical learning?
4. What compliance requirements exist for DAO treasuries?
5. How to ensure treasury security while maintaining accessibility?

## Success Criteria

- [ ] Multi-sig treasury with 3-of-5 approval for major decisions
- [ ] Cognitive gates automate 80%+ of routine transactions
- [ ] Token economics model validated through simulation
- [ ] Compliance reporting automated and auditable
- [ ] Emergency circuit breakers tested and functional
- [ ] 12+ month operating runway secured

## Integration Points

### Blockchain Integration
- Ethereum/Polygon for smart contracts
- IPFS for document storage
- Chainlink for oracle services
- The Graph for treasury analytics

### Traditional Finance
- Bank account integration
- Payment processor connections
- Accounting system integration
- Tax reporting automation

## Next Steps (When Starting This Session)

1. Research DAO treasury best practices
2. Design multi-sig architecture
3. Develop cognitive gate decision logic
4. Model token economics
5. Implement core treasury contracts
6. Test with simulated scenarios
7. Deploy to testnet then mainnet
