3. **Protecting Innovation** - Patent rights are reserved, preventing predatory patent filings
4. **Enabling Research** - Academic and educational use remains free and open
5. **Supporting Sustainability** - Commercial licenses fund continued development

- **TRANSPARENCY** - Open processes and accountable governance
