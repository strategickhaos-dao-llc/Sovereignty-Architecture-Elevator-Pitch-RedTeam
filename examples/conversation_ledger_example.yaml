  attestation: |
    I certify that this ledger was created and maintained in the regular course
    of business as part of my standard R&D documentation practice. Each entry
    was made at or near the time of the conversation it describes. I have
    personal knowledge of the facts recorded herein.
    
    The AI conversations documented here were conducted for legitimate business
    purposes including security analysis, code quality improvement, and technical
    documentation. All recommendations from AI systems were reviewed by me and
    implemented only after human validation and testing.
    
    This ledger uses cryptographic hash chains (SHA3-256) to prevent tampering
    with historical entries. Any modification to past entries would break the
    chain and be immediately detectable.
  signature_date: "2025-11-21"
  gpg_signature: "[Would contain actual GPG signature in production]"

compliance:
  documentation_standard: "ISO 8601 timestamps, SHA3-256 hash chains, GPG signatures"
  retention_policy: "Permanent retention for IP protection and business records"
  privacy_considerations: |
    No personally identifiable information (PII) in conversation logs.
    All content is technical/professional. No confidential client data.
    AI conversations contain only publicly available information and
    internally developed technical content.

    required: false
    reviewer: null
    review_date: null
    approved: null

usage_notes: |
  This example ledger demonstrates proper AI conversation documentation for:
  
  ✅ Research & Development documentation
  ✅ Investor due diligence presentations
  ✅ Patent prosecution support (conception dates)
  ✅ Trade secret protection (documented processes)
  ✅ Internal audit trails
  ✅ Academic/thesis work documentation
  
  ❌ NOT for:
  ❌ Legal advice (AI cannot provide legal advice)
  ❌ Expert testimony (AI cannot be expert witness)
  ❌ Standalone proof of technical facts (requires human validation)
  
  For legal use, supplement with:
  1. Human testimony (sworn declaration)
  2. GPG signatures (non-repudiation)
  3. OpenTimestamps (third-party proof of date)
  4. Supporting evidence (code, tests, results)
