# Legal-Firewall Contract Primitives
# Strategickhaos DAO LLC - Legally-Bounded Generative Systems Engineering (LB-GSE)
#
# This file defines legal primitives that act as governance constraints
# for software generation, prioritization, and validation.
# 
# Based on Wyoming DAO LLC statute (SF0068), iron-clad contract governance,
# charitable irrevocability logic, and fiduciary rules.
