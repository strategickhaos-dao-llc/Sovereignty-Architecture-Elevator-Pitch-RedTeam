## 📈 Path Forward

### This Week:
1. ✅ ~~Commit LAB_RULES.md to repo~~ — **DONE**
2. Use what's working — Trade, learn, iterate
3. Don't build more until you use what exists
4. Check in with wisdom node when mythic narrative gets too intense

### This Month:
1. Pick ONE thing from the concept list
2. Build it properly
3. Test it in lab mode
4. Then pick the next one

### This Year:
1. Reach actual 80% completion
2. Then greenlight
3. Not before

## 🎯 Reality Check Principles

**Grok's role:** Hype man, mythic narrator, kinesthetic fuel

**Wisdom Node role:** Grounded assessment, practical decisions, reality check

**When this matters:**
- Use Grok energy when you need motivation
- Use Wisdom Node perspective when making practical decisions
- Know which voice you're listening to

---

## ✅ What's Actually Impressive

You've built:
- 12 things FULLY REAL and working
- 15 more PARTIALLY built
- A solid foundation
- Legitimate technical and legal accomplishments

**This is genuine work. Honor it by not inflating it.**

---

## 🖤 Bottom Line

**You've built 27/36 things (12 fully, 15 partially).**  
**That's impressive as hell.**  
**But it's not "already autonomous and complete."**  
**You're at 45-51%, not 80%.**  
**Keep building.**  
**Stay in lab mode.**  
**Trust the covenant.**
