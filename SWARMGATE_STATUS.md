# SwarmGate v1.0 Status Report

## ⚠️ VERIFICATION NODE ALERT

**This document separates REAL accomplishments from ASPIRATIONAL goals.**

    hash: caa58d9faee9a10ce46d81d2f21e0da611ff962b8070e22b5d976cc816480698
    provenance: PROVENANCE.md created ✅
    git: Committed locally ✅
    
  legal_entities:
    strategickhaos_dao: Wyoming Entity 2025-001708194 ✅
    valoryield_engine: EIN 39-2923503 ✅
    
  governance_framework:
    status: DOCUMENTED ✅
    files:
      - governance/access_matrix.yaml
      - governance/article_7_authorized_signers.md
      - dao_record.yaml
      - dao_record_v1.0.yaml

  documentation:
    status: COMPLETE ✅
    evidence: Canonical hash computed on real hardware
```

**THIS IS REAL. This has been accomplished.**

## ❌ WHAT'S NOT DEPLOYED (YET)

```yaml
not_deployed:
  smart_contract:
    status: CODE ONLY - NOT DEPLOYED ❌
    reason: Requires Node.js installation and blockchain deployment
    file: CHARITY_SPLITTER_CODE.md
    reality: "Contract exists as code, not on blockchain"
    
  on_chain_immutability:
    status: ASPIRATIONAL ❌
    timeline: Requires deployment
    
  public_launch:
    status: PENDING ❌
    reason: Infrastructure setup required
```

## 🔥 THE CRITICAL DISTINCTION

### What has been accomplished:
- ✅ Created governance framework (SwarmGate YAML)
- ✅ Sealed it with cryptographic hash
- ✅ Documented legal entities (Wyoming DAO LLC, EIN)
- ✅ Committed to git
- ✅ Proved the concept is viable
- ✅ UPL-Safe compliance framework established
- ✅ Access control matrix defined
- ✅ Article 7 authorized signers documented

### What has NOT been accomplished:
- ❌ Deploy smart contract to blockchain
- ❌ Make charitable split "mathematically eternal" on-chain
- ❌ Public launch of DAO infrastructure
- ❌ On-chain governance voting

| Artifact | Status | Location |
|----------|--------|----------|
| Governance Framework | ✅ COMPLETE | `governance/` |
| Legal Entity Docs | ✅ COMPLETE | `legal/` |
| DAO Record | ✅ COMPLETE | `dao_record.yaml` |
| Smart Contract Code | ✅ CODE READY | `CHARITY_SPLITTER_CODE.md` |

## 🎯 NEXT STEPS FOR DEPLOYMENT

1. **Install Node.js** (5 minutes)
2. **Configure environment** (.env setup)
3. **Deploy smart contract to Base Sepolia testnet** (30 minutes)
4. **Verify contract on Basescan**
5. **Update this document with deployment TX**

---

## 💙 VERIFICATION NODE COMMITMENT

**This document exists to maintain honesty about project status.**

- We will not claim something is deployed when it's not
- We will not simulate blockchain transactions
- We will clearly separate code from deployment
- We will update this document when status changes

---

**Last Updated:** See git commit timestamp  
**Status:** Governance SEALED, Deployment PENDING  
**Next Milestone:** Smart contract deployment to testnet

*"The code is real. The deployment is the next step."*
