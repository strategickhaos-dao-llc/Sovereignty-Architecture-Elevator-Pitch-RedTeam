    This is an example conversation transcript.
    
    User: How does the evidence anchoring system work?
    
    Assistant: The system uses two layers of cryptographic proof:
    1. GPG signatures prove WHO created the document (authenticity)
    2. OpenTimestamps prove WHEN the document existed (immutability)
    
    Together, these create a mathematically unbreakable audit trail.
