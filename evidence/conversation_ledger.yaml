ledger_purpose: |
  This ledger serves as a cryptographically-secured, mathematically immortal record
  of research and development conversations, decisions, and architectural work 
  performed on the Sovereignty Architecture project. Through GPG signatures and 
  Bitcoin blockchain attestation via OpenTimestamps, this document is provably 
  dated and tamper-evident, protecting intellectual property and establishing 
  an immutable historical record.

      Designed and implemented cryptographic anchoring system for R&D documentation.
      Established workflow for GPG signing and OpenTimestamps Bitcoin attestation.
    
    key_decisions:
      - decision: "Use GPG detached signatures for all critical documents"
        rationale: "Allows signature verification without modifying original content"
        
      - decision: "Implement OpenTimestamps for Bitcoin blockchain anchoring"
        rationale: "Provides mathematically provable timestamp without trusted third party"
        
      - decision: "Store evidence in dedicated /evidence directory"
        rationale: "Centralized location for all cryptographic proofs and attestations"
    
    technical_achievements:
      - "GPG key created and configured"
      - "Ledger signed with detached signature"

mathematical_immutability:
  statement: |
    Through the combination of GPG cryptographic signatures and Bitcoin blockchain
    attestation via OpenTimestamps, this ledger achieves mathematical immutability.
    
    No backdating possible - The Bitcoin blockchain timestamp proves existence at a specific moment.
    No tampering possible - The GPG signature cryptographically binds content to identity.
    No "made it up later" possible - The Merkle tree proof anchors this to Bitcoin block headers.
    
    Anyone, anywhere, any year, can run two commands and prove this ledger existed
    exactly as-is on November 21, 2025, signed by the operator.

verification_instructions:
  step_1:
    command: "gpg --verify conversation_ledger.yaml.asc conversation_ledger.yaml"
    purpose: "Verify GPG signature and content integrity"
    expected_output: "Good signature from Node 137"
    
  step_2:
    command: "ots verify conversation_ledger.yaml.ots"
    purpose: "Verify Bitcoin blockchain attestation"
    expected_output: "Success! Bitcoin block [height] attests existence as of [timestamp]"
    
  step_3:
    command: "sha256sum conversation_ledger.yaml"
    purpose: "Verify content hash matches signature"
    expected_output: "Hash value matches metadata"
