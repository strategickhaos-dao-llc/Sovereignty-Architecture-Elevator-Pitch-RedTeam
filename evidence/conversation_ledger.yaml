      - "Decision 2: Another key decision to document"

# 1. Add new conversation entries above this comment block
# 2. After each addition, re-sign and re-timestamp:
#    
#    gpg --local-user "YourName" --armor --detach-sign conversation_ledger.yaml
#    ots stamp conversation_ledger.yaml
#    
# 3. Update the ledger_metadata block:
#    - Update sha256 hash (certutil -hashfile or sha256sum)
#    - Update hardened_on date
#
# 4. Anyone can verify this ledger:
#    gpg --verify conversation_ledger.yaml.asc conversation_ledger.yaml
#    ots verify conversation_ledger.yaml.ots
