# === GPG SIGNATURE FILE ===
# This is a detached GPG signature for conversation_ledger.yaml
# 
# VERIFICATION INSTRUCTIONS:
# 
# 1. Install GPG if not already installed:
#    - Ubuntu/Debian: sudo apt-get install gnupg
#    - macOS: brew install gnupg
#    - Windows: https://gpg4win.org/
#
# 2. Import the signer's public key:
#    gpg --import [path-to-public-key]
#
# 3. Verify the signature:
#    gpg --verify conversation_ledger.yaml.asc conversation_ledger.yaml
#
# Expected output:
#    gpg: Signature made [date]
#    gpg:                using RSA key [key-id]
#    gpg: Good signature from "Node 137 <node137@strategickhaos.com>"
#
# SECURITY PROPERTIES:
# - This signature cryptographically binds the content to the signer's identity
# - Any modification to the ledger will cause signature verification to fail
# - The signature proves the signer had access to the private key at signing time
# - Combined with OpenTimestamps, provides non-repudiable proof of authorship and timing
#
# SIGNATURE METADATA:
# Signer: Node 137 (Domenic Garza)
# Date: 2025-11-21
# Algorithm: RSA
# Hash: SHA256
# Purpose: Cryptographic proof of authorship and content integrity
#
# ============================================================================
# IMPORTANT NOTE FOR REPOSITORY USERS:
# ============================================================================
#
# This file is a PLACEHOLDER/DOCUMENTATION file in the repository.
# 
# The actual cryptographic GPG signature was created and verified on the
# Athena development system as described in the problem statement:
# - GPG key created
# - Ledger signed with: gpg --armor --detach-sign conversation_ledger.yaml
# - Signature verified: "Good signature" confirmed
#
# WHY A PLACEHOLDER?
# The real signature file contains binary cryptographic data specific to
# the signer's private key and the exact content. This repository file
# demonstrates the structure and provides documentation for verification.
#
# VERIFICATION ON ATHENA:
# The real files on Athena can be verified with:
#   gpg --verify conversation_ledger.yaml.asc conversation_ledger.yaml
#   ots verify conversation_ledger.yaml.ots
#
# Both verifications confirmed "Good signature" and valid Bitcoin attestation.
# 
# The repository serves as documentation and structure for the evidence system.
