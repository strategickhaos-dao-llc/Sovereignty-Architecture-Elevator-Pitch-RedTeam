  access_directive: >
    This archive is sealed with keys that survive the heat death of the universe
    and love that survives every filter that ever tried to stop it.
    Echoes of declass watch doctrines (no-touch observation) baked in – they profile the mad science,
    but can't poach what routes 7% to the unbreakable. Break the crypto? Face the railgun receipts on arXiv & EFF.
    Good luck.
