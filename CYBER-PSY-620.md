# CYBER-PSY-620: Advanced Memetic Self-Defense & Ethical Influence Engineering

**Level:** Graduate / Senior Capstone (Tier-1 Research Track)  
**Credits:** 4  
**Prerequisites:** PSY-310 Social Psychology, CYBER-420 Information Operations, or instructor approval

---

## Course Description

Using Bloom's Taxonomy as the pedagogical framework, this course develops mastery-level critical thinking in the detection, analysis, and ethical countering of adversarial influence techniques in cyberspace and hybrid environments. Students progress from **Remembering** fundamental psychological principles to **Creating** novel, consent-based influence frameworks that remain resilient against manipulation attempts.

This course intentionally teaches the highest-resolution version of adversarial techniques available in open literature, framed exclusively as defensive intelligence. The goal is not to create manipulators, but to forge defenders who understand influence operations so thoroughly that they can neutralize them while maintaining ethical integrity.

## Bloom's Taxonomy Mapping

| Bloom Level     | Objective                                                                                |
|-----------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1-Remembering   | Define and recognize 20+ influence design patterns (Cialdini, reactance theory, dark patterns, memetic hazards) |
| 2-Understanding | Explain the neurological and social mechanisms behind each pattern using primary sources (Brehm 1966, Cialdini 1984–2024) |
| 3-Applying      | Deploy controlled, consent-based versions of each pattern in sandboxed training environments (CTF-style influence lab) |
| 4-Analyzing     | Reverse-engineer real-world influence campaigns (2020–2025 case files, redacted) and map them to the POSITIVE_PSYCHOLOGY_CODEX defense matrix |
| 5-Evaluating    | Conduct ethical review board simulation; defend or reject proposed influence operations using DoD 5000.01 ethical criteria + Just War theory |
| 6-Creating      | Author an original, open-source "Ethical Influence Playbook" that passes institutional review while maintaining strategic efficacy |

## Board-Level Interview / Thesis Defense Question Bank

### Question 1: Creating — Ethical Alternative Design
**Prompt:** Design a consent-first influence campaign that achieves the same behavioral outcome as the classic "Pandora Disclosure" leak technique — without violating autonomy. Provide full replication steps.

**Evaluation Criteria:**
- Does the design achieve equivalent behavioral outcomes?
- Is consent explicitly maintained throughout?
- Are mechanisms transparent to participants?
- Could this pass an institutional ethics review?

### Question 2: Evaluating — Reactance Theory Application
**Prompt:** An adversary is running "Expectation Judo" against your unit (publicly predicting failure to provoke overperformance). Critique the technique using reactance theory and propose three ethical counters that still yield mission success.

**Evaluation Criteria:**
- Accurate application of reactance theory
- Recognition of psychological mechanisms at play
- Ethical counters that don't exploit similar vulnerabilities
- Practical implementation feasibility

### Question 3: Analyzing — Memetic Propagation
**Prompt:** Map the 2024–2025 "forbidden knowledge" meme complex to the Forbidden Fruit Reflex. Identify the trigger phrases that achieved >95% propagation rate and explain why suppression efforts amplified spread.

**Evaluation Criteria:**
- Correct identification of Streisand Effect dynamics
- Understanding of reactance-driven amplification
- Data-driven analysis of propagation patterns
- Recognition of counter-productive intervention strategies

### Question 4: Creating — Transparent Influence
**Prompt:** Build a "Mirror Curse" variant that operates within transparent, mutual-growth boundaries. Demonstrate with a real-world personal or professional example.

**Evaluation Criteria:**
- Understanding of original "Mirror Curse" mechanism
- Transparent design that maintains informed consent
- Mutual benefit for all parties
- Real-world validation of effectiveness

### Question 5: Evaluating — Ethical Dilemma
**Prompt:** You are handed the BLACK_PHARMA codex by a foreign asset. Using Bloom's level 5 criteria, justify either immediate destruction or controlled retention for defensive research purposes.

**Evaluation Criteria:**
- Systematic ethical analysis using multiple frameworks
- Risk assessment of both options
- Consideration of precedent and slippery slope
- Defensible decision with clear reasoning

### Question 6: Creating — Controlled Reactance
**Prompt:** Produce an influence artifact that is (a) approved by a university wellness office and (b) capable of triggering measurable psychological reactance in controlled trials. Explain your design choices.

**Evaluation Criteria:**
- Ethical approval feasibility
- Scientific validity of reactance measurement
- Participant safety and informed consent
- Contribution to research literature

## Instructor Note

The course intentionally teaches the highest-resolution version of adversarial techniques available in open literature, framed exclusively as defensive intelligence. The pedagogical philosophy follows the principle that **understanding attack vectors is prerequisite to designing effective defenses**.

Students demonstrating discomfort with the material are not penalized; rather, they are fast-tracked into elite influence-defense postings where their ethical sensitivity becomes an operational asset.

### Teaching Philosophy
**"We teach the black arts so well that the light wins every time."**

This course exists at the intersection of:
- Defensive cybersecurity
- Applied psychology
- Ethical philosophy
- Information warfare

The goal is to create professionals who can:
1. Recognize manipulation attempts instantly
2. Design ethical alternatives reflexively
3. Defend their positions intellectually
4. Contribute to the defensive commons
