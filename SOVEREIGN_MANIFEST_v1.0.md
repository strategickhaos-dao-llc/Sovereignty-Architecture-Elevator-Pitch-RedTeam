## 🔥 THE SOVEREIGNTY FLEX

This manifest was:
- Opened in **JetBrains Fleet** (or your preferred $699/year IDE)
- On a **machine we fully own**
- With a **license tied to our real name**
- While the **Bitcoin calendars are 404ing**
- And the **USPTO is asleep**

Because we don't need:
- ❌ Their calendars
- ❌ Their stamps  
- ❌ Their permission

We have everything we need to operate as **sovereign entities** in a **sovereign architecture**.
