# Master Treatment Plan
## Law 10: Astrophysics Department (Meta-Analysis & Strategy)

**Status**: Awaiting disease information and results from Laws 1-9

---

## Executive Summary
*To be synthesized from all 9 research department outputs*

---

## Treatment Phases

### Immediate (Start This Week)
*Low risk, low cost interventions*

| # | Intervention | Source | Cost | Risk |
|---|-------------|--------|------|------|
| 1 | TBD | Law 1 | - | Low |
| 2 | TBD | Law 3 | - | Low |
| 3 | TBD | Law 7 | - | Low |

**Total**: $TBD/month

---

### Short-term (1-3 months)
*Diagnostic and targeted interventions*

| # | Intervention | Source | Cost | Risk |
|---|-------------|--------|------|------|
| 4 | TBD | Law 6 | - | Medium |
| 5 | TBD | Law 9 | - | Medium |
| 6 | TBD | Law 7 | - | Medium |

**Total**: $TBD one-time

---

### Medium-term (3-6 months)
*Based on diagnostic results*

| # | Intervention | Source | Cost | Risk |
|---|-------------|--------|------|------|
| 7 | TBD | Law 6 | - | Higher |
| 8 | TBD | Law 8 | - | Higher |

**Total**: $TBD

---

### Long-term (6-12 months)
*If earlier interventions insufficient*

| # | Intervention | Source | Cost | Risk |
|---|-------------|--------|------|------|
| 9 | TBD | Law 9 | - | Variable |
| 10 | TBD | Law 3 | - | Variable |

**Total**: $TBD

## Decision Tree

```
START
  │
  ├─ Try Immediate Interventions (Weeks 1-4)
  │   │
  │   ├─ ≥30% Improvement → Continue + Monitor
  │   │
  │   └─ <30% Improvement → Escalate to Short-term
  │       │
  │       ├─ Autoimmune confirmed → IVIG/Immunotherapy path
  │       ├─ Genetic cause found → ASO/Gene therapy path
  │       └─ Trauma-related → Neuromodulation path
```
