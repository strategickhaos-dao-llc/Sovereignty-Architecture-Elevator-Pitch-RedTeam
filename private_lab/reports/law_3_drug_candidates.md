## Virtual Screening Results
*To be performed using ChEMBL database (2.4M compounds)*

### Search Parameters
- Blood-brain barrier penetration: Required
- ADMET profile: Safe
- Drug-likeness: Lipinski compliant

---

## Novel Molecules (If Repurposing Fails)
*De novo design will only proceed if:*
1. No suitable repurposed drugs found
2. Patient opts for experimental path
3. Funding secured ($50K-200K)

---

## Predicted Binding Affinity
*AlphaFold3 structure predictions and molecular docking results pending*

---

## Next Steps
1. [ ] Receive disease information
2. [ ] Identify target proteins
3. [ ] Run AlphaFold3 structure prediction
4. [ ] Virtual screening (ChEMBL)
5. [ ] ADMET modeling
6. [ ] Rank candidates

---

## Timeline
**Estimated completion**: 21 days after receiving disease information
