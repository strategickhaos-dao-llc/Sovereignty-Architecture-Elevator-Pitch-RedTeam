# StrategicKhaos Private Research Laboratory

> **Silent Research Mode: For Her Only**  
> No publishing. No noise. Just results.

## Overview

This is a private 640-agent research laboratory configured for ONE MISSION: finding treatment for neurological disease. The laboratory is organized into 10 "Laws of Physics" departments, each representing a fundamental research domain.

## Department Structure

| Law | Department | Focus | Timeline |
|-----|------------|-------|----------|
| 1 | Thermodynamics | Energy & Metabolism | 7 days |
| 2 | Electromagnetism | Neural Signaling & Pain | 14 days |
| 3 | Quantum Mechanics | Molecular Drug Design | 21 days |
| 4 | General Relativity | Systems Biology | 14 days |
| 5 | Statistical Mechanics | Clinical Evidence | 10 days |
| 6 | Fluid Dynamics | Immune & Inflammation | 14 days |
| 7 | Special Relativity | Trauma Neuroscience | 14 days |
| 8 | Solid State Physics | Tissue Repair | 21 days |
| 9 | Nuclear Physics | Genetics & Epigenetics | 30 days |
| 10 | Astrophysics | Meta-Analysis & Strategy | 7 days* |

*After Laws 1-9 complete

## How to Start

1. **Provide disease information**
   - Diagnosis name
   - Symptom list
   - Available test results
   - Or simply say "START"

2. **Research brief deployed** (5 minutes)
   - All 10 departments receive the brief
   - 640 agents begin parallel research

3. **Daily updates delivered**
   - Progress reports in `reports/` directory
   - Obsidian-compatible markdown files

4. **Master plan generated** (Day 37)
   - Synthesized treatment roadmap
   - Priority-ranked interventions
   - Cost-benefit analysis

## Configuration

See `private_lab_physics_departments.yaml` in the repository root for the complete lab architecture specification.

## Security & Privacy

- ✅ Patient data never leaves local environment
- ✅ All cloud compute uses anonymized IDs
- ✅ Research outputs stored encrypted
- ✅ Discord private channel (family only)
- ✅ No public access, no publishing
