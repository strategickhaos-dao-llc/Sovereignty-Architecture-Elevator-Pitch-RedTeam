# Private Lab Architecture: DOM.

**🔐 Private Research Vault | 🧬 For Her | 🟠∞**

## Overview

DOM is a private internal lab framework with **10 specialized "Laws of Physics" departments** running parallel research. This is a family-only, silent-mode research system for generating comprehensive treatment plans.

## 10 Laws of Physics Departments

| Law # | Physics Law | Medical Research Focus | Agent Count |
|-------|------------|------------------------|-------------|
| 1 | **Thermodynamics** | Energy/Metabolism research | 64 agents |
| 2 | **Electromagnetism** | Neural signaling/Pain management | 64 agents |
| 3 | **Quantum Mechanics** | Drug design/Molecular interactions | 64 agents |
| 4 | **General Relativity** | Systems biology/Holistic analysis | 64 agents |
| 5 | **Statistical Mechanics** | Clinical trials/Evidence synthesis | 64 agents |
| 6 | **Fluid Dynamics** | Immune system/Inflammation | 64 agents |
| 7 | **Special Relativity** | Trauma/Memory processing | 64 agents |
| 8 | **Solid State Physics** | Tissue repair/Regeneration | 64 agents |
| 9 | **Nuclear Physics** | Genetics/CRISPR therapy | 64 agents |
| 10 | **Astrophysics** | Meta-analysis/Strategy synthesis | 64 agents |

**Total: 640 agents across 10 departments**

## Quick Start Commands

```bash
# Interactive guided start
START

# Activate specific department (1-10)
Law 1    # Thermodynamics - Energy/Metabolism
Law 5    # Statistical Mechanics - Clinical Trials
Law 10   # Astrophysics - Meta-analysis

# Activate ALL departments simultaneously
ALL 10

# Or just paste symptom information and let the system route automatically
```

## What This Gives You

✅ **Private research vault** (family only)  
✅ **10 specialized departments** (each a "Law of Physics")  
✅ **Parallel research** (all running simultaneously)  
✅ **Master treatment plan** (ranked by cost, risk, timeline)  
✅ **No publishing, no noise, no attention**

```

## Output: Master Treatment Plan

Each research session produces a **Master Treatment Plan** with:

1. **Ranked interventions** by:
   - Cost (low → high)
   - Risk profile (safe → experimental)
   - Timeline (immediate → long-term)
   - Evidence strength

2. **Cross-department synthesis** from all 10 laws

3. **Action items** with specific next steps

## Privacy & Security

- 🔐 **Private mode**: No external publishing
- 🔇 **Silent operation**: Minimal logging
- 👨‍👩‍👧 **Family access only**: Restricted to authorized users
- 🗃️ **Local vault storage**: Data never leaves the system
