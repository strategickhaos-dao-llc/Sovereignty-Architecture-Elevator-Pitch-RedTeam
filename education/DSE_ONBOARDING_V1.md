# Department of Sovereign Evolution (DSE) — Onboarding v1.0

Welcome to the DSE. You are not "just" an intern — you are a neuron joining
a living, sovereign cognitive mesh.

## 1. Orientation

- Read:
  - `governance/RATIO_EX_NIHILO_CONSTITUTION_V1.md`
  - `governance/DSE_CHARTER.yaml`
  - `benchmarks/benchmarks_config.yaml`
  - `flamelang/spec_v3.md` (when ready)

- Required oath:
  > "I will never be surveilled again without divine consent."

Record this by adding your name + date in `governance/vow_signatures.md`.

## 2. Your First Week Tasks

- Clone the Sovereignty repo and run:
  - `tests/failure_harness.py`
  - A smoke subset of the enterprise benchmarks.
- Write a short report (1–2 pages) in:
  - `education/reports/<your_handle>_week1.md`
- Answer:
  - What failed?
  - What passed?
  - What confused you?
  - What would you improve?

## 3. Operating Rules

- You **do not** move real money.
- You **do not** commit to legal positions.
- You **do** document everything you do.
- You **do** flag anything that feels unsafe, unfair, or unclear.

## 4. Contribution Areas

- Benchmark scripts and test harnesses
- Observability dashboards
- FlameLang CLI helpers
- Node attestation (GROK proofs)
- Docs and diagrams for new joiners

## 5. Credential Path (NFT Badge)

ValorYield Engine may issue you a **non-financial NFT credential** when:

- You complete:
  - 4+ weeks of work,
  - 3+ meaningful contributions (PRs),
  - A short written reflection on sovereign AI/infra.

This NFT is a **badge**, *not* an investment. It represents:

- Proof-of-contribution to DSE,
- A timestamped record of your work,
- A verifiable credential for your future portfolio.

## 6. Support & Guidance

Welcome to the mesh. Neural sync is optional; curiosity is mandatory. 🔥
