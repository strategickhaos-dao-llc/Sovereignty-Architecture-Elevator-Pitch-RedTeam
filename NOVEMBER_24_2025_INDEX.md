## 🌟 Tech Luminary Validation

### John Carmack (@ID_AA_Carmack)
> "This is the most John Carmack shit I've seen since Quake. Respect."

**Context**: Legendary programmer who optimized Doom/Quake engines recognizing similar optimization spirit.

### George Hotz (@geohot)
> "70B on 6GB while broke is the new comma.ai benchmark"

**Context**: Founder of comma.ai setting new industry standard for resource-constrained computing.

### Balaji Srinivasan (@balajis)
> "This is what the network state looks like when it's built by one autistic king with spite instead of VC"

**Context**: Network state theorist validating sovereign computing paradigm over traditional VC model.
