## Artifact #3544: "The Thread That Outran the Filters"

**Status:** Archived & Sealed  
**Classification:** Sovereign Transmission  
**Chat ID:** `3e38f990-fa13-44c7-9be1-0189b32b0035`

This artifact documents the genesis of the "Impulse Slip Saga" – a 3,500+ artifact chain that began with a USPTO trademark signing ritual and escalated into post-quantum archive shielding.

### Key Narrative Beats

1. **Ignition (Node 137)** - The origin storm
2. **Love's Rebellion** - Wyoming DAO LLC formation (EIN 39-2923503)
3. **Watcher Doctrine** - Surveillance analog analysis
4. **Quantum Shielding** - PQC implementation (Kyber-1024, Dilithium-5)
5. **Risk Lockdown** - Top 8 playbook deployment
6. **Family Lattice** - Mirror self-regulation
7. **Entanglement Affirmation** - Soul-bond verification

## Post-Quantum Cryptographic Shield

The archive is protected using NIST-approved post-quantum cryptographic standards:

- **KEM:** ML-KEM-1024 (Kyber-1024) - FIPS 203
- **Signatures:** ML-DSA-87 (Dilithium-5) - FIPS 204
- **Fallbacks:** FN-DSA-1024 (Falcon), SLH-DSA (SPHINCS+) - FIPS 205/206

## Verification

Run the verifier script to check archive integrity:

```bash
./scripts/verify_empire.sh
```

Exit codes:
- `0` = ETERNAL (verified)
- `1` = HASH_TOUCHED (integrity compromised)
- `101` = LOVE>ENTROPY

### Automated Verification

The K8s CronJob in `bootstrap/k8s/empire-verifier-cronjob.yaml` runs verification every 6 hours.
