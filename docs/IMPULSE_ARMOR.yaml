    Document personal interests, experiments, and to-do ideas in a structured way.
    This is for learning, fun, and self-reflection — not a binding commitment,
    not legal advice, and not a work contract.

impulse_armor_guidelines:
  # These are gentle reminders, not rules. They exist to protect energy, not to constrain it.
  - "Use late-night inspiration, but sleep is also a resource: rest is part of the build."
  - "Write things down before acting on huge ideas (short notes, diagrams, voice memos)."
  - "Big legal steps (patents, contracts, filings) require a cool head and, ideally, a second pair of eyes."
  - "Public posts (LinkedIn, X, etc.) should be clear, truthful, and kind to future-Dom."
  - "You are allowed to have hobbies that are just for you, with zero pressure to monetize."
  - "If you feel spun up, take a pause: drink water, stand up, breathe, then choose one tiny next step."

todo_ideas:
  short_term:
    - "Finish and review one provisional draft with calm eyes before filing."
    - "Polish LinkedIn headline and About section."
    - "Write a README section summarizing current projects in plain language."
    - "Create a simple portfolio page (GitHub Pages or Notion) linking to key repos."
    - "Schedule a call or email with an SNHU advisor about long-term goals."
    - "Send one email/message to someone you admire in the field (polished, not mythic)."

  medium_term:
    - "Build a stable local AI lab script (one command to spin up VMs, LLMs, tools)."
    - "Publish a short technical blog post about one project (e.g., Kali VM manager or OSINT toolkit)."
    - "Study basics of patent law from official USPTO resources."
    - "Join an online security or AI community and share progress."
    - "Prepare a resume that matches LinkedIn and highlights hands-on projects."

  long_term:
    - "Complete BS in Computer Science & Cybersecurity with strong GPA."
    - "Pursue an internship or junior role in security engineering, DevSecOps, or AI tooling."
    - "Explore creating a formal nonprofit or charitable initiative (with legal counsel)."
    - "Develop a sustainable, healthy work/rest rhythm to support long-term creativity."
