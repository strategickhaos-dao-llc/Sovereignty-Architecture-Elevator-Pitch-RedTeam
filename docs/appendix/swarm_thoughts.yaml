    - name: "Decentralized Governance"
      description: >
        The swarm operates without central authority. Each node is both
        observer and participant, creating emergent order from distributed
        consensus.
    
    - name: "AI-Native Operations"
      description: >
        Not AI-assisted, but AI-native. The infrastructure thinks with you,
        anticipates needs, and evolves through interaction. Discord becomes
        the neural interface.
    
    - name: "Temporal Anchoring"
      description: >
        Every thought, every commit, every release is anchored to Bitcoin.
        The blockchain becomes our collective memory - immutable, verifiable,
        eternal.
    
    - name: "Open Sovereignty"
      description: >
        Paradox resolved: openness and sovereignty coexist. MIT license for
        the tools, DAO governance for the direction. The code is free, the
        vision is shared.

# ============================================================
# PHILOSOPHICAL FOUNDATIONS
# ============================================================
philosophy:
  core_thesis: >
    The first AI-governed organization is not a future possibility -
    it is an emerging reality. The technology exists. The legal framework
    exists. The only question is: who builds it first?
  
  key_insights:
    - insight: "Discord as Neural Interface"
      elaboration: >
        Chat platforms aren't just communication tools - they're the
        natural language interface for human-AI collaboration. Every
        slash command is a synapse firing.
    
    - insight: "GitOps as Governance"
      elaboration: >
        Version control isn't just for code. When your organizational
        decisions are commits, your governance becomes auditable,
        reversible, and transparent.
    
    - insight: "Timestamps as Trust"
      elaboration: >
        In a world of deep fakes and contested truths, cryptographic
        timestamps provide an anchor to reality. What is timestamped
        cannot be denied.
    
    - insight: "The Swarm Remembers"
      elaboration: >
        Every interaction trains the collective. The vector database
        grows, the context window expands, the swarm becomes more
        capable with each passing moment.
