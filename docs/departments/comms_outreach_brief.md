## Simple Story: "What Is This Program?"

### For Donors

> **StrategicKhaos Educational Swarm** is an innovative educational platform that uses AI to create personalized learning experiences. We've developed 100 carefully crafted questions aligned with university-level computer science standards, and we're using artificial intelligence to generate engaging video lessons for each one.
>
> Think of it as "living courseware" — educational content that adapts, scales, and continuously improves to meet learners where they are. Your support helps us bring quality technical education to students who might not otherwise have access.

### For Students

> **Want to level up your tech skills?** StrategicKhaos offers 100 challenging questions that go beyond memorization. Each question comes with an AI-generated video that walks you through the concepts, plus assessments to prove you've mastered the material.
>
> It's like having a personal tutor available 24/7, helping you develop the critical thinking skills employers actually want.

### For Press/Media

> **StrategicKhaos** is pioneering a new approach to technical education that combines AI-generated content with cloud-native delivery. The platform delivers 100 university-level computer science topics through a Kubernetes-based system that can scale to serve thousands of learners simultaneously.
>
> What makes it different? Every piece of content targets higher-order thinking skills — analysis, evaluation, and creation — rather than rote memorization. It's designed to produce graduates who can think, not just recite.

### For SNHU/Academic Partners

> **StrategicKhaos Educational Swarm** is a competency-based learning platform aligned with Bloom's Taxonomy Levels 5-6. Our 100-question curriculum maps to BS/CS program outcomes and can supplement existing coursework or serve as standalone professional development.
>
> The platform leverages AI for content generation and Kubernetes for delivery, demonstrating real-world technologies while teaching about them. Students learn cloud-native architecture by using a cloud-native learning platform.

## Non-Technical Explanation of AI Videos + K8s Pods ("Living Courseware")

### What Are AI-Generated Videos?

Imagine having access to an expert instructor who can create a custom video lesson for any topic you need to learn. That's what our AI video system does:

1. **We write the question** — A carefully crafted challenge that makes you think
2. **AI creates the video** — Using the latest AI technology to generate clear, engaging explanations
3. **Experts review it** — Real educators check every video for accuracy and clarity
4. **You learn** — Watch at your own pace, rewind, and review as needed

**Key point:** The AI helps us create content faster and more affordably, but humans are always in the loop to ensure quality.

### What Are "KnowledgePods"?

Think of KnowledgePods as individual learning units that live in the cloud. Each pod contains:

- One question from our curriculum
- The video lesson
- Practice exercises
- Assessment to prove mastery

**Why is this special?**

- **Always available** — The pods run in the cloud, accessible 24/7
- **Automatically scales** — Popular topics get more resources automatically
- **Always updated** — When we improve content, you get the latest version instantly
- **Cost-effective** — Unused pods can "sleep" and wake up when needed

**Simple analogy:** It's like having a library where the books come to you, the most popular ones automatically get more copies, and they're always the latest edition.

### Why "Living Courseware"?

Traditional textbooks and courses are static — they're the same today as they were when published. Our "living courseware" is different:

- **Continuously improved** based on learner feedback
- **Automatically updated** when technology changes
- **Personalized** to each learner's needs
- **Measured** so we know what's working

## FAQ Section

### For Partners / SNHU

**Q: How does this align with accreditation standards?**
> A: Our curriculum maps to standard BS/CS program outcomes and Bloom's Taxonomy Levels 5-6. We can provide detailed competency mapping for articulation discussions. The platform is designed to supplement, not replace, accredited programs.

**Q: Who creates and reviews the content?**
> A: Questions are developed by curriculum experts with input from industry practitioners. AI generates initial video content, which is then reviewed by subject matter experts for accuracy and pedagogical soundness. We maintain documentation of this review process.

**Q: How do you ensure academic integrity?**
> A: Our assessments focus on higher-order thinking skills that are difficult to shortcut. We use multiple assessment types (written analysis, design projects, presentations) and can integrate with existing proctoring solutions if required.

**Q: What student data do you collect?**
> A: We collect learning analytics (progress, assessment scores, time on task) to improve the learning experience. We are FERPA-aware and can sign appropriate data protection agreements. We do not sell student data.

### For Auditors

**Q: What security certifications do you have?**
> A: We follow NIST Cybersecurity Framework guidelines and implement security best practices. We can provide documentation of our security controls, vulnerability management program, and incident response procedures.

**Q: How do you handle security vulnerabilities?**
> A: We operate a defensive-only security program. Vulnerabilities in our own systems are identified through authorized testing and our bug bounty program (limited to our own assets). All activities are CFAA-compliant.

**Q: What is your data retention policy?**
> A: Learning progress data is retained for the duration of the learner relationship plus 7 years for record-keeping. Video content and educational materials are retained indefinitely. We can provide detailed data lifecycle documentation.

**Q: Do you conduct any offensive security operations?**
> A: No. All security activities are strictly defensive and limited to systems we own and control. We do not conduct any offensive operations, even in response to attacks against us. We report security incidents to appropriate authorities.

### For Donors

**Q: How will my donation be used?**
> A: Donations support infrastructure costs (cloud hosting), AI content generation, expert content review, and program development. We can provide detailed budget breakdowns and are committed to transparency in financial reporting.

**Q: Is this a nonprofit?**
> A: StrategicKhaos operates as a Wyoming DAO LLC with educational mission focus. We are exploring nonprofit status options and can discuss the governance structure in detail.

**Q: How do you measure impact?**
> A: We track learner completion rates, assessment scores, learning time, and follow-up surveys on skill application. We are developing a comprehensive impact measurement framework and will publish regular impact reports.

### For General Public

**Q: Is this free?**
> A: Pricing model is still being determined. Our goal is to make quality education accessible. We will offer scholarships and reduced-cost options for learners who need them.

**Q: Do I need technical background?**
> A: The 100 questions assume some foundational knowledge. We recommend basic familiarity with computing concepts. We're developing prerequisite assessments to help learners start at the right level.

**Q: What technology do I need?**
> A: A modern web browser and internet connection. Videos are optimized for various connection speeds. Mobile access is supported but desktop/laptop recommended for best experience.
