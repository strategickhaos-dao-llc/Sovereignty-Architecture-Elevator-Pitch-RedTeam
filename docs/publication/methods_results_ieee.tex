\subsection{Benchmark Methodology}
Performance benchmarks were conducted on a heterogeneous local cluster consisting of four consumer-grade workstations (AMD Ryzen 9 7950X, Intel i9-13900K, NVIDIA RTX 4090/4080 GPUs, 128 GB DDR5 RAM) running Ollama 0.13.0 with models served exclusively on GPU (CUDA 12.4). Cloud baselines used vendor-provided APIs (Grok 4, GPT-5.1) under identical prompt templates. Each configuration executed ten trials preceded by three warm-up runs; reported values are medians with 95\% bootstrapped confidence intervals. Wall-clock latency was measured from prompt submission to final token receipt using high-resolution monotonic timers. Temperature was fixed at 0.7; top-p sampling was disabled for deterministic comparison. Model binaries were pinned by SHA-256 hash; exact versions and environment metadata are archived in the project supplement (doi:10.5281/zenodo.XXXXXXX). Composite ``DOM Score'' weights were defined as Speed (40\%), Freedom from content filtering (20\%), Operational sovereignty (20\%), and Cost (20\%).

\subsection{Results}
Local inference with Qwen2.5:14b-instruct-q6\_K achieved a median end-to-end reflex-loop latency of 41.2~s (95\% CI [40.8, 41.7]) for 8\,192 $\rightarrow$ 4\,096 token transformations, yielding 298 tokens/s. Cloud baselines exhibited higher raw throughput (GPT-5.1: 3\,789 tokens/s) but comparable or higher overall latency under equivalent symbolic-load prompts. Smaller local models (Gemma3:1b) demonstrated $>$800 tokens/s for short contexts, confirming suitability as lightweight swarm agents. The composite DOM Score ranked the fully local stack highest (100/100) due to perfect sovereignty, zero recurring cost, and unrestricted stylistic fidelity, compared with 68/100 (GPT-5.1) and 59/100 (Claude Opus 4). Detailed per-model latency curves and radar comparison are presented in Fig.~\ref{fig:dom_radar} and Fig.~\ref{fig:latency_curves}.
