# SOVEREIGN LEGAL REVIEW REQUEST — Node137 Capsule
SLOG: Strategickhaos / Node137 — REQUEST — 2025-11-23T18:11:30Z

Requested by: Domenic Garza / Strategickhaos DAO LLC

Summary
Provide a short summary of the item needing review and links to repo files (e.g., docs/CHARITABLE_COMMITMENT.md, docs/proofs/*, docs/templates/*).

Requested by: Domenic Garza / Strategickhaos DAO LLC

Scope of review (please review and advise on each item below):
- 501(c)(3) formation mechanics and timeline for the Project Charity (state filings, EIN, IRS determination).  
- Donor tax‑deductibility requirements and acceptable donor acknowledgements (forms, thresholds, required language).  
- Review grant_agreement.md and donor_acknowledgement.md templates; identify edits to avoid impermissible private benefit.  
- Confirm permissibility of routing corporate donations through DAO/LLC operations and proper documentation/flow to avoid private benefit or self‑dealing.  
- Review multisig guidance and recommended signers from a corporate governance and fiduciary perspective.  
- Advise on AML/KYC and state charitable solicitation registration obligations for crypto and large donors.  
- Review public announcement wording (docs/release/DRAFT_ANNOUNCEMENT.md) for legal risk and required disclaimers.  
- Confirm whether the LEGAL_SHIELD.md precedents language is safe to publish as-is or needs limiting language.  
- Advise on whether any additional corporate entity or trust structure is recommended to shield donors and preserve charitable intent.  
- Identify material legal risks and recommend mitigation steps and timeline.

Files & links (please review these repo files):
- docs/CHARITABLE_COMMITMENT.md  
- docs/proofs/* (hash, .ots, .sig placeholders)  
- docs/legal/LEGAL_SHIELD.md  
- docs/legal/LEGAL_CAVEAT.md  
- docs/templates/grant_agreement.md  
- docs/templates/donor_acknowledgement.md  
- docs/operations/multisig_guidance.md  
- docs/release/DRAFT_ANNOUNCEMENT.md

Deliverables requested:
- Bullet list of required edits to templates and public copy.  
- Recommended corporate/charitable structure and formation checklist with estimated timelines and costs.  
- List of required policies (donor receipts, restricted funds, record retention, conflict of interest).  
- Confirmation language for public communications and PR that minimizes legal risk.

Priority: High — we plan to solicit institutional donors after counsel sign‑off.

SOVEREIGN ACTIONS REQUESTED
- Please perform an expedited counsel review and provide redlines and recommended edits.  
- If full written opinion is required, provide an estimated fee and timeline.  
- Create a short, counsel‑approved acknowledgement paragraph we can paste in the public release that preserves the repo disclaimers while enabling donor outreach.
