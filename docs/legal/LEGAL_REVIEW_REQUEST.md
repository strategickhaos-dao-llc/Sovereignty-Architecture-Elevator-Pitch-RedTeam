status: SEALED — AWAITING COUNSEL SIGN-OFF

**IMPORTANT LEGAL NOTICE** — Tax-deductibility and 501(c)(3) status are **pending formal recognition**. No representation of current deductibility is made. All structures subject to final counsel review.

Requested by: Domenic Garza / Strategickhaos DAO LLC

Scope of review:
- 501(c)(3) formation mechanics and timeline (state filings, EIN, IRS determination)  
- Donor tax-deductibility requirements and acceptable donor acknowledgements  
- Review grant_agreement.md and donor_acknowledgement.md templates  
- Confirm permissibility of routing corporate donations through DAO/LLC → charity  
- Multisig guidance and fiduciary signers  
- AML/KYC and state charitable solicitation obligations (crypto + large donors)  
- Review public announcement wording (DRAFT_ANNOUNCEMENT.md)  
- Confirm LEGAL_SHIELD.md is safe to publish or needs edits  
- Recommend any additional entity/trust to shield donors  
- Full risk list + mitigation timeline

Files to review:
docs/CHARITABLE_COMMITMENT.md | docs/legal/* | docs/templates/* | docs/release/DRAFT_ANNOUNCEMENT.md

Deliverables requested:
- Edits to templates & public copy  
- Formation checklist + cost/timeline  
- Required policies list  
- Safe public language for PR

Priority: HIGH — institutional donor outreach blocked until sign-off
