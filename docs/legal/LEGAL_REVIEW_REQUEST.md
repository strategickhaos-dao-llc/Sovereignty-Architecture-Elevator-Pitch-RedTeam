## 🔐 Commit/Tag Ritual for Legal Reviews

### Step 1: Freeze the State

Before requesting legal review, create an **immutable reference point**:

```bash
# 1. Commit all changes that need review
git add [files requiring review]
git commit -m "legal: Prepare [document name] for attorney review"

# 2. Create a review tag with timestamp
DATE=$(date +%Y%m%d)
TAG="legal-review-${DATE}-[document-type]"
git tag -a "$TAG" -m "Legal review checkpoint: [brief description]

This tag marks the exact state of [document names] submitted for 
Wyoming-licensed attorney review on $(date).

Reviewer: [Attorney name/firm]
Review type: [Charitable compliance/Contract review/Entity structure/etc]
Review ticket: [Reference number if applicable]"

# 3. Push tag to origin (creates permanent reference)
git push origin "$TAG"

# 4. Record the commit SHA and tag
COMMIT_SHA=$(git rev-parse HEAD)
echo "Review Reference:"
echo "  Tag: $TAG"
echo "  Commit: $COMMIT_SHA"
echo "  Date: $(date -Iseconds)"
echo "  Documents: [list files]"
```

### Step 2: Document the Review Request
