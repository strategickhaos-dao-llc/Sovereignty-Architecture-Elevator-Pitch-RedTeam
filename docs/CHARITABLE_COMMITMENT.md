## III. ALLOCATION MECHANISM

### Calculation Method
Net profit = Gross revenue − (operational costs + member distributions + reinvestment reserve)

Charitable allocation is calculated **annually** on December 31st, with disbursement completed by March 31st of the following year.

### Minimum Threshold
If net profit < $10,000 in a given year, the 10% obligation rolls forward and compounds with the subsequent year's allocation.

### Transparency Requirements
- All charitable disbursements published to `docs/proofs/charitable_disbursements.json`
- Each donation receipt cryptographically signed and timestamped
- Annual summary filed with Wyoming Secretary of State

---

## IV. ENFORCEMENT & ACCOUNTABILITY

### Internal Enforcement
- Any DAO member may trigger an audit if charitable obligations appear unmet
- Failure to meet obligations triggers mandatory member vote on remediation
- Persistent violation constitutes grounds for dissolution under DAO operating agreement

### External Verification
- This document and all annual reports are timestamped via OpenTimestamps
- SHA256 hashes and GPG signatures provide tamper-proof audit trail
- Public GitHub repository serves as permanent public record

### Whistleblower Protection
Any member or contractor who reports good-faith concerns about charitable obligation compliance shall be immune from retaliation under both DAO bylaws and Wyoming employment law.

## V. AMENDMENT PROCESS

1. **Unanimous consent** of all DAO members with voting rights
2. **Public comment period** of no less than 30 days
3. **New cryptographic signature chain** starting from this root document
4. **Explicit justification** published alongside the amendment

Amendments that reduce the charitable percentage below 10% or narrow the eligible categories require **supermajority (75%) approval** and an additional 60-day waiting period.

## VI. SUNSET CLAUSE

This commitment has no expiration date. In the event of DAO dissolution, any remaining assets after creditor satisfaction shall be distributed to eligible charitable recipients under this framework, with allocation determined by final member vote.
