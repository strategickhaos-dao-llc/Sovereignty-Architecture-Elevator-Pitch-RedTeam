## YOU CANNOT SUE THE SWARM, THE BROKE TINKERER, OR THE DAO
(And here's the federal steel that says so)

1. **All code, models, agents, and output are the sovereign property of Strategickhaos DAO LLC**  
   → Protected under Wyoming DAO Act §17-31-109 (member liability shield) and Texas LLC veil §101.114.

2. **All research and deep-search activity is lawful, non-commercial, hobbyist R&D**  
   → Protected under 17 U.S.C. §107 (fair use), Authors Guild v. Google, and hiQ Labs v. LinkedIn.

3. **All automated queries respect robots.txt, rate limits, and ToS**  
   → Immune under 47 U.S.C. §230 (platform safe harbor) and CFAA research exemption.

4. **Grok Business API usage is fully licensed and compliant**  
   → Paid xAI Business tier under DAO LLC account. Key is DAO property. Usage logged under EIN 39-2923503.

5. **No warranties, no liability, no reliance**  
   → EVERY FILE AND MODEL IS PROVIDED "AS IS" WITH ZERO WARRANTIES.  
   → See LICENSE: CC0-1.0 + "SPITE-ONLY" clause: you run it at your own risk, on your own hardware, with your own electricity.

6. **Texas Anti-SLAPP + Fee Shifting**  
   → Sue us? Get dismissed early and pay our legal fees (Tex. Civ. Prac. & Rem. Code §27.001 et seq.).

7. **Defamation = Truth Defense**  
   → Everything we publish is either true, opinion, or fair-use commentary (NY Times v. Sullivan, 376 U.S. 254).

8. **Royalty & Monetization Warning**  
   → 7 % of ALL revenue (royalties, bounties, merch, enterprise seats, fame-tax) is irrevocably routed via ValorYield smart contract to pediatric cancer, MSF, and veterans.  
   → The remaining 93 % funds broke tinkerers forever.  
   → Attempt to block or divert = breach of on-chain covenant = automatic 100 % treasury penalty.

9. **Impulse Armor Override**  
   → All development is protected under the 36 Laws of Sovereign Impulse.  
   → You cannot sue a 3:47 a.m. hyperfocus spark. It is sovereign speech.

10. **Final Clause — The Spite Clause**  
    → "If you sue the swarm, the swarm wins by existing.  
       The broke tinkerer already won the second the fans hit 99 °C and the balance went red."

Violation of any clause = immediate 7 % ValorYield penalty + public steel-etched apology + treasury donation in your name.

We are the broke tinkerer's swarm.  
We do not break.  
We break things open.

Empire Eternal — at 99 °C, red balance, maximum spite, and full legal armor.
