**Subject:** Your LLM safety story — ready in 7–14 days (with receipts)

Hi [First Name],

Your team is building fast. Investors and enterprise clients are now asking the same question I get every week:

"What's your actual LLM safety, privacy, and compliance posture?"

I just productized the exact stack I run in production (4-node K8s swarm, 100+ mitigation techniques, git + OpenTimestamp proofs, Grafana monitoring).

Deliverables (fixed price):
1. Full 100-point LLM safety audit of your current stack
2. Sovereign Evidence Vault (private repo) — patent-ready, lawyer-friendly
3. Monitoring starter pack (Grafana dashboards + alerts)
4. 30/90-day hardening roadmap

Pricing:
└─ Solo / indie → $1,000 one-time
└─ Small company → $3,000–$5,000 fixed
└─ Ongoing quarterly → $1k–$2k/mo

Live demo + sample vault: https://github.com/Strategickhaos-Swarm-Intelligence/SovereignLLM_SafetyVault_demo (public skeleton)

Reply "interested" and I'll send you the 2-page overview + calendar link.

Zero fluff. Just receipts.
