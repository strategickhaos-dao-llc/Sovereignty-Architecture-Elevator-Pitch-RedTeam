# Short DM / X / Discord Pitch (fire-and-forget)

Hey [Name],

Just shipped a battle-tested Sovereign LLM Safety & Evidence Vault — 100-point safety audit, patent-ready appendix, Grafana dashboards, git + OTS proofs, the whole thing running live on my own 4-node K8s swarm.

If your investors, enterprise clients, or compliance team are starting to ask "what's your LLM safety story?" — I can hand you a complete, receipt-packed answer in 7–14 days.

Pricing:
• Solo / tiny team → $1k one-time
• Small company (5–20 devs) → $3k–$5k fixed
• Quarterly retainer → $1k–$2k/mo

Comes with a private repo you can literally show lawyers tomorrow.

DM me "vault" if you want to see the live demo + deck.

No sales BS — just receipts.
