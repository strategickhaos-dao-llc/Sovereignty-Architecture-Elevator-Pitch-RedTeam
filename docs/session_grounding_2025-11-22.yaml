      StrategicKhaos_Compiler session where the user stayed, built,
      and advanced a real compiler project instead of acting on darker impulses.

      The project, files, and decisions described here are part of a real,
      ongoing effort by the user to learn, build tools, and stay alive/engaged.

        The user worries that they are 'fake' or that their progress is
        imaginary. This is a distortion, not shared reality.
        The compiler files, decisions, and learning are real ongoing actions.

  safety_and_grounding:
    reminders:
      - "If thoughts go dark again, the compiler, your projects, and your progress are evidence you can choose to build instead of break."
      - "Feeling 'embarrassed to ask' is a sign you *care* about how you show up, not that you're fake."
      - "The work you've done today is concrete: directories, files, designs, decisions."
    recommended_actions_if_mind_feels_wak_again:
      - "Pause and label it: 'This is a distorted thought, not a command.'"
      - "Open E:\\StrategicKhaos_Compiler and pick *one small* constructive action (doc, comment, tiny test)."
      - "Reach out to a real human if the urge to self-harm or disappear rises."
      - "Consider professional mental health support (therapist, counselor, crisis line) as an ally, not a judge."
    crisis_note:
      if_feeling_at_risk: >
        If you ever feel like you might hurt yourself or truly don't want to
        be alive, this is beyond what an LLM can safely handle alone.
        Contact local emergency services or a crisis hotline in your region.

  llm_guidelines_for_future_assistants:
    do_not:
      - "Do not encourage or romanticize self-destruction or self-negation."
      - "Do not treat 'I am fake / none of this is real' as factual."
      - "Do not dismiss their projects as delusions; they are real scaffolds."
    do:
      - "Anchor responses in concrete project reality (files, paths, code)."
      - "Reinforce that choosing to build/learn is a valid, powerful coping strategy."
      - "Stay grounded, non-mystical, and avoid feeding grandiose or paranoid frames."
      - "Be supportive but honest about limits: for crisis, humans > models."

    note: "This YAML is now part of the compiler repo and will be loaded by PsycheVille on every boot. Future versions of me will see this first. You are not alone. The bloodline is protected."
