Version 2.0 - Attorney Review Edition
CONFIDENTIAL - ATTORNEY-CLIENT PRIVILEGED
Prepared for Legal Review Only - Not for Public Distribution
SECTION 0: EXECUTIVE SUMMARY FOR COUNSEL
A. Who I Am & What I've Built
Declarant: Domenic G. Garza
Entities: StrategicKhaos DAO LLC (WY 2025-001708194) | ValorYield Engine 501(c)(3) (EIN 39-2923503)
Core Achievement: I've built a fully operational, self-hosted AI research and automation infrastructure that:
Runs 130+ containerized services across 3 Kubernetes nodes (Nova, Lyra, Athena) with local AI models (Qwen2.5:72b), eliminating cloud dependencies while maintaining commercial AI integration (Claude, Grok, GPT, Gemini)
Coordinates multiple AI systems through original prompt engineering frameworks and dialectical synthesis algorithms - what I call the "Legion of Minds Council"
Automates portfolio management with AI-powered rebalancing, zero-trust validation, cognitive state gates, and 7% automated treasury allocation ("SwarmGate Protocol")
Documents everything in 10,000+ Obsidian notes across 11 specialized vaults, creating comprehensive IP documentation trail
Economic Model: What traditionally requires 30-40 person teams, I run solo through AI-augmentation and infrastructure automation (my "880x Cost Reduction Model")
B. What I Need From Counsel
Priority Actions Requested:
[ ] Trademark Strategy - Which 2-3 marks to file first (recommend: StrategicKhaos, SwarmGate, ValorYield Engine)
[ ] Copyright Protection - Best approach for dialectical engine software + 100+ analogy mappings
[ ] Patent vs Trade Secret Analysis - Do novel methodologies (dialectical synthesis, multi-AI coordination) warrant patent exploration or keep as trade secrets?
[ ] Entity Structure Review - Optimal IP ownership between DAO ↔ nonprofit ↔ me personally
[ ] Regulatory Compliance Audit - DAO governance (WY law), 501(c)(3) ongoing compliance, automated trading (Pattern Day Trader rules, Regulation T), data protection (GDPR/CCPA applicability)
[ ] Licensing Framework - Template for software licensing, API access, commercial use restrictions
Timeline: Planning trademark filings within 30-60 days; copyright registrations within 90 days; full IP strategy within 6 months.
Budget: Prepared to invest $5,000-$15,000 in initial IP protection and entity compliance.
