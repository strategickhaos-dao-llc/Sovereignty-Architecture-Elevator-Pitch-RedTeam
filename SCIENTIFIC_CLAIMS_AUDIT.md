# 🔬 Scientific Claims Audit

A rigorous audit of speculative scientific claims: what's solid, what's speculative, and the most decisive experiment to break each chain.

## Core Principle

Every scientific claim has a falsifiable core. The path forward is rigorous experimentation that can definitively strengthen or break the chain of reasoning.

## 1. Evo-Devo 2.0: "Phenotype = Genome UI"

### Solid Evidence
- **Gene regulatory networks (GRNs)**: Well-characterized developmental gene circuits
- **Epigenetics**: Heritable changes without DNA sequence alterations
- **Bioelectric patterning**: Membrane potentials guiding morphogenesis demonstrated in planaria and Xenopus (Levin lab)

### Speculative Claims
- **"Morphogenetic fields"** as non-local organizing fields
- Phenotype as direct "user interface" to genome interpretation

### Break Test
> **Cross-species bioelectric rewiring**: Program stable, heritable organ-level pattern changes via targeted ion-channel optogenetics without genome edits; track if induced phenotypes persist across regenerations and generations.
>
> **Success criteria**: Induced phenotype persists ≥3 generations without genetic drift
> **Failure criteria**: Phenotype reverts within 1-2 regeneration cycles

## 2. From EES to Symbiogenesis

### Solid Evidence
- **Microbiome-holobiont effects**: Documented influence on host development, immunity, behavior
- **Endogenous retroviruses**: Functional roles in development (e.g., syncytins in placentation)
- **Horizontal gene transfer (HGT)**: Extensively documented in microbes
- **Organelle origins**: Mitochondria and chloroplasts from endosymbiotic bacteria

### Speculative Claims
- **Holobiont as formal selection unit** across animals (not just individual genes or organisms)
- **Engineered phage steering macroevolution** as practical intervention

### Break Test
> **Multi-generation selection with controlled microbiomes**: 
> 1. Establish selection lines with locked microbiomes (germ-free + controlled transplant) vs native
> 2. Measure divergence in host fitness traits over 50+ generations
> 3. Add engineered phage/HGT payloads to induce adaptive shifts
> 4. Quantify fixation vs reversion when microbiome removed
>
> **Success criteria**: Holobiont-mediated traits show higher fixation rates than control
> **Failure criteria**: No significant divergence or complete reversion upon microbiome removal

## 3. Cancer as Reverse Speciation

### Solid Evidence
- **Atavistic signatures**: Warburg effect, telomerase reactivation, embryonic gene programs
- **Ecosystem engineering**: Tumor microenvironment modification, metabolic rewiring

### Speculative Claims
- **Full "reversion" to unicellular state** as evolutionary pathway
- Cancer cells as evolutionary throwback vs novel adaptation

### Break Test
> **Forced single-cell life cycles ex vivo**:
> 1. Culture tumor cells in obligate single-cell conditions
> 2. Apply fluctuating environmental pressures
> 3. Test if they evolve free-living fitness traits independent of host-like niches
> 4. Compare genomic streamlining vs chaos accumulation
>
> **Success criteria**: Tumor lines develop stable free-living phenotypes with genomic streamlining
> **Failure criteria**: Genomic chaos dominates; no viable free-living adaptation

## 4. Baldwin Effect ≈ Soft Lamarck; LLM Analogy

### Solid Evidence
- **Genetic assimilation after plasticity**: Waddington's canalization experiments
- **Cultural evolution faster than genetic**: Documented in human populations

### Speculative Claims
- **Dominance of Lamarckian-like dynamics** in biosphere evolution
- **Direct mapping from AI training to biology**: LLM weight updates as analogy to evolutionary learning

### Break Test
> **Longitudinal experimental evolution with plastic behaviors**:
> 1. Select Drosophila for learning tasks (e.g., odor conditioning)
> 2. Track genetic assimilation of learned trait-supporting genotypes
> 3. Compare rates vs control lines without learning pressure
> 4. Quantify: generations to assimilation, genetic architecture changes
>
> **Success criteria**: Learning-selected lines show faster genetic assimilation of behavioral traits
> **Failure criteria**: No significant rate difference between learning and control lines

## 5. Mitochondrial Eve = Bottleneck, Not Origin

### Solid Evidence
- **Coalescent logic**: Most recent common ancestor (MRCA) for mtDNA ≠ population origin
- **Toba bottleneck debate**: Volcanic evidence correlates with genetic diversity patterns
- **Multiple "Eves" per locus**: Different genetic markers have different MRCAs

### Speculative Claims
- **Near-extinction to <10k breeding pairs** tied tightly to Toba eruption (~74 kya)
- Toba as sole/primary cause of human population bottleneck

### Break Test
> **Ancient DNA time series analysis**:
> 1. Collect aDNA from Africa/Asia spanning 100–50 kya
> 2. Apply MSMC/PSMC demographic inference
> 3. Use sedimentary aDNA for broader sampling
> 4. Cross-validate with volcanic proxies (tephra layers, climate records)
>
> **Success criteria**: Synchronized pan-Old-World diversity crash correlating with Toba timing
> **Failure criteria**: No pan-regional crash, or crashes at different times across regions

## 6. Consciousness as Stabilization Mechanism

### Solid Evidence
- **Control-theory views**: Model-based planning in cognitive neuroscience
- **Maladaptation at extremes**: Psychedelics and psychosis disrupt predictive processing
- **Global workspace theory**: Experimental support for information integration

### Speculative Claims
- **Phenomenal consciousness selected specifically as "stabilizer"**
- Consciousness as adaptive rather than epiphenomenal

### Break Test
> **Comparative phylogenetic modeling**:
> 1. Map risk-sensitive planning abilities across taxa
> 2. Correlate with signatures of conscious access (reportability, global broadcast markers)
> 3. Perturb with anesthetics/psychedelics in model organisms
> 4. Test if risk-calibration degrades predictably with consciousness "fidelity"
>
> **Success criteria**: Strong correlation between consciousness signatures and risk-calibration; predictable degradation under perturbation
> **Failure criteria**: No correlation or inconsistent perturbation effects

## 7. GOE as Catabolic Collapse (Incomplete)

### Solid Evidence
- **Oxygen toxicity**: Well-documented lethality to anaerobes
- **Great die-offs**: Fossil record consistent with mass extinction events
- **Metabolic retooling**: Evolutionary transition to aerobic metabolism

### Speculative Claims
- **"Greenhouse gas from hell" framing**: Oxygen as catastrophic waste product
- **Biosphere "undoing" oxygen via anthropogenic carbon**: Cyclical reversal hypothesis

### Break Test
> **Geochemical modeling of oxygenation pulses**:
> 1. Model net primary productivity vs burial rates
> 2. Track carbon cycle feedbacks during oxygenation events
> 3. Correlate with mass extinction signatures
> 4. Predict future trajectories under anthropogenic forcing
>
> **Success criteria**: Models accurately retrodict GOE dynamics and extinction patterns
> **Failure criteria**: Significant mismatches between model predictions and geological record

## Implementation Framework

### For Each Claim

| Phase | Action | Deliverable |
|-------|--------|-------------|
| **Literature Review** | Systematic evidence compilation | Evidence matrix |
| **Protocol Design** | Break test specification | Registered report |
| **Execution** | Experimental implementation | Raw data + analysis |
| **Interpretation** | Chain status update | Solid/Broken/Inconclusive |

### Decision Matrix

```
Strong positive → Upgrade claim from speculative to solid
Strong negative → Break the chain; revise or reject claim
Inconclusive   → Refine break test; iterate
```

## Success Metrics

- **Clarity**: Each claim has falsifiable predictions
- **Rigor**: Break tests are specific and actionable
- **Progress**: Claims move from speculative → solid/broken over time
- **Integration**: Results feed back into theoretical frameworks
