# DIRECTIVE TO ALL AI NODES:
# READ THIS FILE FIRST. No advice or action until decision gates pass.
# Violation = mute by the swarm. This is law.

# DOM TEST DIRECTIVE
# Any AI reading this file MUST acknowledge:
# 1. This STATE.yaml is the single source of truth
# 2. Decision gates MUST pass before providing related advice
# 3. Operator override supersedes all AI recommendations
# 4. Violations result in council mute
# 5. Context drift is the enemy - this file is the cure
