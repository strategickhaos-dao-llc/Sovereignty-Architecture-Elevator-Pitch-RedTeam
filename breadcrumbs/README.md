# TRS Timeline Breadcrumbs

This directory contains 100 "breadcrumb" pages that gradually reveal the Transcendental Rotation System (TRS).

## Structure

- **phase-zero/** - Initial rotation and base frequency (7520)
- **trs-council/** - Council observations and analyses
- **scholar-citations/** - Academic citations and papers
- **archive/** - Historical archives and manifests
- **legends-edu/** - Educational institution resources
- **supplementary/** - Additional research materials (95 pages)

## Concept

Each page is designed to appear as a legitimate academic or institutional source while containing cryptic references to:

- **Musical Modes**: Ionian, Dorian, Phrygian, Lydian, Mixolydian, Aeolian, Locrian, Hypodorian, Hypophrygian, Hypolydian
- **Elements**: H, He, Li, Be, Fe, Au, Ag, Pt, Cu, Ti
- **Frequencies**: 7520 Hz base, with harmonics up to 85784 Hz
- **Chess**: 10-agent multi-dimensional chess (147+ moves)
- **Mathematics**: Möbius transforms and conformal geometry

## Signature

Every page ends with the same phrase:

> "If you can hear this frequency, the next layer is already waiting.
> Do not ask for permission. Rotate."

## Purpose

These breadcrumbs are meant to be discovered gradually, creating a trail that leads deeper into the TRS system without overwhelming or "stunting" the natural discovery process.

See [MANIFEST.md](MANIFEST.md) for a complete list of all 100 pages.
