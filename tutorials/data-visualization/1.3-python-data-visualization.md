# 1.3 Python for Data Visualization

## Learning Objectives

- Identify data types and data structures
- Import modules
- Use the matplotlib module

## Introduction to Python

Python is an open-source programming language frequently used for data analysis and data visualization. Open source means a user can access the source code and create new functions and libraries to share with others. Python is free to download and use, and several user interfaces are available to support reading, writing, and using Python.

Python was developed during the late 1980s and initially released in 1994. A new version of the language, Python 3.0, was introduced in 2008 and included major changes to the Python syntax to make the code more readable. As a result, Python 3.0 is not backward compatible with earlier versions. For example, Python 2.7 programs cannot run on Python 3.0 or later. Smaller releases, denoted by Python 3.x, make incremental changes to the language.

## Running Python

The Python interpreter is a computer program that executes Python code. An interactive interpreter is a program that allows the user to execute one line of code at a time.

In many systems, the Python interpreter is started by entering `python` in the command line. In some cases, additional software or administrator privileges may be required. Other Python development environments exist, such as Jupyter, Anaconda, and Cloud9. Some are web-based and do not require the installation of additional software.

## Data Types and Data Structures

Python uses several data types to represent data. The most important data types in Python are shown in the following table.

### Table 1.3.1: Basic data types in Python

| Type    | Description                                                                                          | Examples                                  |
|---------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| int     | An integer number.                                                                                   | 0, -1, 4                                  |
| float   | A decimal number or number in scientific notation.                                                   | 2.7168, -2.0, 1.618, 6.02e23, 1.60e-19    |
| string  | A sequence of characters (stored and output surrounded by single or double quotes).                  | 'Hello', 'pie', '3.14'                    |
| boolean | A value that is either true or false.                                                                | True, False                               |

Data can be organized into more complex data structures known as containers. Common containers are listed in the table below.

### Table 1.3.2: Basic data structures in Python

| Type                  | Description                                                                                | Examples                                                                                          |
|-----------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| set                   | An unordered collection of items.                                                          | {1, 2, 3}, {'First name', 'Last name'}                                                            |
| list                  | An ordered collection of changeable items. Two-dimensional arrays can be formed from lists of lists. | [1, 2, 3], ['Height', 6.1], [[1, 2], [3, 4]]                                                      |
| tuple                 | An ordered collection of unchangeable items.                                               | (1, 2, 3), ('Hello', 'World')                                                                     |
| dictionary (or dict)  | A collection of mappings between keys and values.                                          | {'Home': '310-555-5555', 'Office': '951-555-5555'}, {'C': 'do', 'D': 're', 'E': 'mi', 'F': 'fa', 'G': 'sol'} |

### Practice: Data types and data structures

Match the data type or structure to the example:

- `42` → **int**
- `3.14159` → **float**
- `'I love statistics!'` → **string**
- `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]` → **list**
- `{'CS1': 'Intro to Computer Science', 'Ma1': 'Calc 1'}` → **dictionary**

## Importing Modules

Many commands for data visualization and analysis in Python require the use of modules, or external libraries of commands. Modules are imported using the `import` command. The `as` keyword can be used to create an alias.

**Example:** The two code blocks below perform the same action.

```python
# Imports the pandas library
import pandas

# Directly accesses the read_csv function in pandas
unemployment = pandas.read_csv('unemployment.csv')
```

```python
# Imports the pandas library using the alias pd
import pandas as pd

# Uses the alias pd to reference the function in pandas
unemployment = pd.read_csv('unemployment.csv')
```

### Table 1.3.3: Common Python data visualization and analysis modules

| Module name        | Alias | Description                                     | Link to documentation                      |
|--------------------|-------|-------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| numpy              | np    | Mathematical functions, required by other libraries | [numpy.org](https://numpy.org)             |
| scipy.stats        | st    | Statistical functions                           | [scipy.org](https://scipy.org)             |
| pandas             | pd    | Data frames, statistical functions              | [pandas.pydata.org](https://pandas.pydata.org) |
| matplotlib.pyplot  | plt   | Data visualization                              | [matplotlib.org](https://matplotlib.org)   |
| scikit-learn       | sks   | Machine learning and data analysis              | [scikit-learn.org](https://scikit-learn.org) |
| seaborn            | sns   | Data visualization                              | [seaborn.pydata.org](https://seaborn.pydata.org) |
| quandl             |       | Data analysis                                   | [quandl.com](https://www.quandl.com)       |

### Practice: Importing modules

1. **Complete the code to import the pandas module using the alias in the table above:**
   ```python
   import pandas as pd
   ```

2. **Complete the code to import the matplotlib.pyplot module using the alias in the table above:**
   ```python
   import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
   ```

## The matplotlib Module

The matplotlib module can be used for plotting in Python. matplotlib, short for MATLAB plotting library, replicates the plotting capability of MATLAB, an engineering-oriented programming language.

matplotlib is not included with Python, but can be downloaded and installed from [https://matplotlib.org/downloads.html](https://matplotlib.org/downloads.html). matplotlib also requires the NumPy module, which includes many general mathematical functions.

The `plt.plot()` function plots data onto a graph. Different types of graphs can be specified, as discussed elsewhere. After the data is plotted, the graph can be displayed on the console or saved to a file. The `plt.show()` function displays the graph. The `plt.savefig()` function saves the graph to a file.

### Table 1.3.4: matplotlib functions for labeling and annotating plots

| Function    | Description                                          |
|-------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| title()     | Specifies title of plot                              |
| xlabel()    | Specifies x-axis label                               |
| ylabel()    | Specifies y-axis label                               |
| text()      | Creates a text label                                 |
| annotate()  | Creates a text label for a specific data point       |
| legend()    | Creates a legend for the plot                        |

### Example: Unemployment rates

The code below loads a dataset containing unemployment rates in the United States from 1980 to 2017 and plots the data as a line chart.

See the accompanying Jupyter notebook for the complete working example.

### Practice: Using matplotlib to set plot parameters

In the following questions, assume that the matplotlib.pyplot module has already been imported as plt.

1. **Enter the command that sets the y-axis label of a plot to 'Height':**
   ```python
   plt.ylabel('Height')
   ```

2. **Enter the command that sets the title of a plot to 'Height Distribution' and sets the font size to 16:**
   ```python
   plt.title('Height Distribution', fontsize=16)
   ```

## Multiple Plots

Multiple sets of data can be plotted on the same axis. The following code plots two categories named `total` and `speeding` from the dataset named `car_crashes` on the same set of axes, forming an overlay bar graph.

### Example: Automobile collisions

The code below plots the number of automobile collisions related to speeding and the total number of collisions on the same set of axes. The data is presented as an overlay bar chart in which two bar charts are overlaid on each other.

See the accompanying Jupyter notebook for the complete working example.

### Practice: Overlay bar charts

1. In the overlay bar graph above, the bars for total collisions are overlaid on top of the bars for speeding-related collisions. **True**

2. The length of a total bar not covered by a speeding-related collisions bar represents collisions not related to speeding. **True**
