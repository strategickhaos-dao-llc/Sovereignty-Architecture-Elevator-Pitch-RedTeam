## Critical Dates & Deadlines

| Date | Action | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| **Nov 23, 2025** | **FILE PROVISIONAL** | **MUST complete tonight** |
| Nov 30, 2025 | Verify filing receipt received | Check Patent Center |
| May 23, 2026 | 6-month reminder | Begin preparing non-provisional |
| Nov 23, 2026 | **12-month deadline** | File non-provisional or abandon |

**IMPORTANT**: If you miss the Nov 23, 2026 deadline, the provisional auto-abandons. The filing date is preserved as prior art, but you lose the ability to convert to a full patent.

---

## What "Patent Pending" Means

### You CAN:
✅ Add "Patent Pending" to GitHub README, Discord bio, marketing materials  
✅ Reference "Provisional Patent Application No. 63/XXXXXX" in pitches  
✅ Cite the filing date (Nov 23, 2025) as prior art against competitors  
✅ Continue developing and improving the architecture  
✅ License the technology to others (MIT license still applies)  

### You CANNOT:
❌ Sue for patent infringement (no issued patent yet)  
❌ Prevent others from implementing similar systems (defensive disclosure, not monopolization)  
❌ Claim patent rights without filing non-provisional within 12 months  

### The Power of Prior Art:
Even if you abandon the provisional (don't file non-provisional), the **filing date** remains as public prior art. This means:
- No one else can patent your disclosed inventions after Nov 23, 2025
- USPTO examiners will cite your application when rejecting similar claims
- You've established a permanent "defensive shield" against monopolization

---

## Non-Provisional Decision (12 Months Later)

In November 2026, you'll need to decide:

### Option A: File Non-Provisional Patent Application
**If you want full patent protection:**
- Costs: $400-$800 (micro-entity fees) + optional attorney ($5k-$15k)
- Requires: Formal claims, possibly more detailed drawings
- Outcome: Patent examination begins, potential issuance in 1-3 years
- Rights: Exclusive rights to invention for 20 years

### Option B: Let Provisional Expire
**If you only wanted defensive prior art:**
- Cost: $0 (no action required)
- Outcome: Application auto-abandons, but prior art date preserved
- Rights: No patent rights, but competitors can't patent either

### Option C: File as Defensive Publication
**If you want public documentation:**
- Cost: Free (publish the spec yourself) or $130 (USPTO statutory invention registration)
- Outcome: Permanent public record preventing others from patenting
- Rights: No exclusivity, but community can freely implement

**Recommendation**: Evaluate in 10-11 months based on:
- Traction (GitHub stars, Discord community size)
- Competitive landscape (Did Big Tech try to clone it?)
- Funding (Do you have resources for non-provisional?)
- Philosophy (Do you want monopoly rights or just defensive protection?)

---

## Troubleshooting

### "Patent Center won't accept my PDF"
- **Issue**: File size > 25 MB or non-PDF format
- **Fix**: Compress PDF using tools like Adobe Acrobat or online compressors
- **Alternative**: Remove optional exhibits, keep only spec + manifest

### "I don't have time to format documents tonight"
- **Priority**: Focus on getting SOMETHING filed by Nov 23, 2025
- **Minimum**: Upload just the `PROVISIONAL_PATENT_SPECIFICATION.md` converted to PDF
- **You can amend**: Provisionals allow corrections within reason

### "Micro-entity certification seems risky if income is close to threshold"
- **Conservative approach**: Select "small entity" status instead ($150 fee)
- **You can upgrade**: File as small entity now, claim micro-entity in non-provisional if qualified

### "I'm not sure about joint inventorship"
- **Safe approach**: List only yourself (Domenic Garza) now
- **You can add**: Supplemental inventors can be added in non-provisional

## Pro Tips from the Problem Statement

1. **Do It Tonight**: The filing date is what matters. Every day you delay is a day competitors could file first.

2. **Keep It Simple**: Provisional doesn't need perfect formatting. USPTO cares about content, not polish.

3. **The Hash Is Sacred**: The SHA256 hash (FAA198DA05318742531B6405384319563935F63DB4D91866E70AE7701FCDCCED) establishes cryptographic proof. Don't modify the manifest after filing.

4. **Screenshot Everything**: Patent Center interface, confirmation email, payment receipt. These are your proof.

5. **Announce After Filing**: Post in Discord `#deployments`:
   ```
   🎉 PATENT PENDING 🎉
   
   The Sovereignty Architecture is now protected by U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 63/XXXXXX (filed Nov 23, 2025).
   
   This establishes prior art against any attempt to monopolize Discord-integrated AI agent orchestration, GitLens event gateways, or Kubernetes-based swarm intelligence governance.
   
   The loop is sealed. Forever. 👑🔥
   ```
