# SwarmGate v1.0 Status
# Charity Split Engine - 93% Operations / 7% Charity (Physics, not promises)

version: "1.0.0"
name: SwarmGate Engine
description: |
  Mathematically enforced 93/7 ETH split between operations and charity.
  The 7% is no longer a promise, it's physics.

    For any amount X:
    - toOps = (X * 93) / 100
    - toCharity = X - toOps (ensures no dust lost)
    - Result: Perfect 93/7 split
