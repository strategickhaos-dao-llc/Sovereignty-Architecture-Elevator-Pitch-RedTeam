# 🎲 Rubik's Cube Algorithms ↔ Scientific View ↔ Biological Systems ↔ Periodic Elements

## Overview

Scientists and mathematicians view Rubik's Cube algorithms as sequences of rotations (moves like U, D, F, B, L, R and their primes/inverses) that manipulate the 3x3x3 puzzle's state, grounded in group theory where the cube's configuration space has ~43 quintillion permutations. God's number (minimal moves for any solve) is 20 for quarter-turn metric. As of 2025, advancements include AI-reinforced solvers (e.g., DeepCubeA evolutions using neural networks for sub-20-move solutions) and quantum algorithms for permutation optimization, as presented at ACM SIGGRAPH 2025 and quantum puzzle symposia.
