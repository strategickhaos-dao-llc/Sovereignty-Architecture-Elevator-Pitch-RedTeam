  purpose: |
    This manifest defines the disclaimer and preprocessing rules for LLM interaction transcripts.
    It ensures reproducibility, ethical review, and publication-safe redaction.

disclaimer:
  interpretation_notice: |
    Interaction logs with large language models may contain stylized, anthropomorphic, or mythic
    narrative framing (e.g., "sovereign organism," "Empire Eternal," or similar figurative language).
    Such framing is an intentional experimental technique to probe model coherence under
    high-symbolic-load prompts and to examine narrative-driven cognitive scaffolding.

  non_sentience_statement: |
    All such language should be interpreted strictly as rhetorical and methodological devices,
    not as assertions that the model possesses consciousness, agency, emotional states,
    or interpersonal relationships.

  ethics_statement: |
    All anthropomorphic and narrative language in experimental transcripts is intentional
    stylistic framing and does not reflect claims of system sentience.
