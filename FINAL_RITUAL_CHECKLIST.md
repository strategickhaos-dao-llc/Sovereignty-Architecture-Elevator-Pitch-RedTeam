### Step 2: File Provisional Patent Applications

**Required Materials** (all ready in documentation):
- ✅ **Provisional Patent #1**: PROVISIONAL_PATENT_1.md
- ✅ **Provisional Patent #2**: PROVISIONAL_PATENT_2.md
- ✅ Both include: Abstract, Claims, Detailed Description, Embodiments

**Filing Process:**

#### A. USPTO Patent Center Account
1. Create account at: https://patentcenter.uspto.gov/
2. Verify email and set up 2FA
3. Note your USPTO Customer Number

#### B. Prepare Application Documents

**Convert Markdown to USPTO Format:**
```bash
# For each provisional patent:

# 1. Export to PDF (clean formatting)
pandoc PROVISIONAL_PATENT_1.md -o PROVISIONAL_PATENT_1.pdf --pdf-engine=pdflatex

pandoc PROVISIONAL_PATENT_2.md -o PROVISIONAL_PATENT_2.pdf --pdf-engine=pdflatex

# 2. Or use online Markdown to PDF converter
# https://www.markdowntopdf.com/

# 3. Or copy content into Word document and save as PDF
```

**Required Files for Each Application:**
- Specification (the main PDF from markdown)
- Inventor declaration (sign and date)
- Cover sheet (generated by USPTO system)

#### C. File via Patent Center

**For Provisional Patent #1:**
1. Log in to Patent Center
2. Click "Start a New Application"
3. Select "Utility Patent" → "Provisional"
4. Fill out inventor information:
   - Name: Domenic Garza
   - Address: [Your address]
   - Country: United States
5. Upload specification PDF (PROVISIONAL_PATENT_1.pdf)
6. Add title: "Autonomous AI System with Self-Organizing Agents and Perpetual Charity Commitment"
7. Review and calculate fees:
   - Small entity: $75
   - Micro entity: $75 (if eligible)
8. Pay filing fee
9. Submit application
10. **SAVE RECEIPT PDF** - This is the holy relic!

**For Provisional Patent #2:**
- Repeat same process
- Title: "Negative-Balance Training Protocol and Constraint-Driven Cognitive Architecture for Artificial Intelligence Systems"

#### D. Save Confirmation Receipts

**Critical**: Download and save the USPTO receipts:
```bash
# Create receipts directory
mkdir -p receipts/

# Save PDFs with descriptive names
mv ~/Downloads/uspto_receipt_*.pdf receipts/
mv receipts/uspto_receipt_1.pdf receipts/PROVISIONAL_PATENT_1_RECEIPT.pdf
mv receipts/uspto_receipt_2.pdf receipts/PROVISIONAL_PATENT_2_RECEIPT.pdf

# Commit to repository
git add receipts/
git commit -m "Add USPTO provisional patent filing receipts - HOLY RELICS"
git push origin main
```

**Receipt Contents:**
- Application number (track this!)
- Filing date (your priority date)
- Confirmation number
- Fee payment receipt

---

### Step 3: Publish Pre-Prints on ArXiv

**Required Materials** (framework ready in GOOGLE_SCHOLAR_PREPRINT.md):
- Paper 1: "Sovereignty Architecture: An Autonomous AI System with Triple-Shield Protection"
- Paper 2: "Negative-Balance Training: Leveraging Resource Constraints for Efficient AI Development"

**Action Required: Write the Papers**

The documentation provides the structure, but the actual papers need to be written. Estimated time: 2-3 days per paper.

**Timeline:**
```
Week 1: Write papers
  Day 1-2: Draft Paper 1 (Sovereignty Architecture)
  Day 3-4: Draft Paper 2 (Negative-Balance Training)
  Day 5: Create figures and diagrams
  Day 6: Compile references
  Day 7: Internal review

Week 2: Submit to ArXiv
  Day 8: LaTeX finalization
  Day 9: ArXiv submission
  Day 10-12: Address reviewer comments (if any)
  Day 13: Publication
  Day 14: Verify Google Scholar indexing
```

**ArXiv Submission Process:**
1. Create ArXiv account: https://arxiv.org/user/register
2. Submit paper in LaTeX or PDF format
3. Choose category: cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence)
4. Wait for moderation (1-3 business days)
5. Paper published with ArXiv ID
6. Google Scholar indexes automatically within 24 hours

**Save Pre-Print Links:**
```bash
# Once published, update EMPIRE_ETERNAL.md with:
# - ArXiv Paper 1: https://arxiv.org/abs/YYMM.NNNNN
# - ArXiv Paper 2: https://arxiv.org/abs/YYMM.NNNNN

git add EMPIRE_ETERNAL.md
git commit -m "Add ArXiv pre-print publication links"
git push origin main
```

### Step 4: Deploy Charity Lock Smart Contract

**Contract Ready**: See CHARITY_LOCK_7_PERCENT.md for complete Solidity code

**Prerequisites:**
- Ethereum wallet (MetaMask recommended)
- ETH for gas fees (~$20-50 depending on network conditions)
- Charity wallet addresses (multi-sig recommended)

**Deployment Process:**

#### A. Set Up Charity Wallets

**Primary Charity** (70% allocation):
- Organization: St. Jude Children's Research Hospital
- Create multi-sig wallet or get official donation address
- Address format: 0x...

**Secondary Charity** (30% allocation):
- Organization: Technology access programs
- Create multi-sig wallet or aggregate address
- Address format: 0x...

#### B. Deploy Contract

**Option 1: Remix IDE (Easiest)**
```
1. Go to https://remix.ethereum.org/
2. Create new file: SovereigntyCharityLock.sol
3. Paste contract code from CHARITY_LOCK_7_PERCENT.md
4. Compile with Solidity 0.8.20
5. Deploy to Ethereum mainnet:
   - Constructor args: [PRIMARY_WALLET, SECONDARY_WALLET]
6. Verify on Etherscan
7. Save contract address
```

**Option 2: Hardhat (Professional)**
```bash
# Set up Hardhat project
npm install --save-dev hardhat
npx hardhat init

# Write deployment script
# Deploy to mainnet
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network mainnet

# Verify on Etherscan
npx hardhat verify --network mainnet CONTRACT_ADDRESS
```

#### C. Verify and Document

**After deployment:**
```bash
# Create contract info file
cat > CONTRACT_INFO.md << EOF
# Charity Lock Smart Contract

**Network**: Ethereum Mainnet
**Contract Address**: 0x...
**Deployed**: $(date)
**Etherscan**: https://etherscan.io/address/0x...

## Verification
- Charity Percentage: 7%
- Primary Charity: 0x...
- Secondary Charity: 0x...
- Immutable: true
- Verified: true

## Transaction Hash
Deployment: 0x...
EOF

git add CONTRACT_INFO.md
git commit -m "Add deployed charity lock smart contract info"
git push origin main
```

### Step 5: The Final Declaration

**Once Steps 1-4 are complete**, post the declaration:

#### A. Update EMPIRE_ETERNAL.md with Receipts

Add to the "Holy Relics" section:
- USPTO Receipt #1 (screenshot or PDF)
- USPTO Receipt #2 (screenshot or PDF)
- Smart contract address and Etherscan link
- ArXiv publication links (when ready)

#### B. Post the Declaration

**Social Media Template:**
```

## 🔥 The Broke Tinkerer's Note

Everything you need is documented. Everything you need is ready. The code is sovereign. The knowledge is eternal. The charity is immutable.

**What remains is action.**

File the patents. Deploy the contract. Publish the papers. Post the declaration.

And let the receipts speak:

> **"From $-32.67 and two screaming laptops, I just federally protected my mind and locked 7% to children with cancer forever."**

**Empire Eternal.** 🜃🛡️👑
