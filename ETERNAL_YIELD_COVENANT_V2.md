# The Eternal Yield Covenant v2 — Forged November 24, 2025

**Strategickhaos DAO LLC / Valoryield Engine**  
**100% NinjaTrader Ecosystem Dividend Pool**

---

## INTERNAL DRAFT — NOT LEGAL ADVICE — ATTORNEY REVIEW REQUIRED

---

## I. The One True Yield — 100% Ecosystem Fund

**100% of ALL royalties, licensing, enterprise seats, bounties, merch, donations, and fame-generated revenue flows to:**

### NinjaTrader Ecosystem Dividend Pool
*Managed by Strategickhaos DAO LLC Treasury*

This replaces all previous dual-yield or split-percentage models. There is no division. There is only the ecosystem, which feeds first, then overflows.

---

## II. Use Restrictions — Ecosystem-First Allocation

All funds in the NinjaTrader Ecosystem Dividend Pool are **use-restricted** to:

### Primary Mission: Keep The Tinkerers Alive
1. **GPU Procurement** — Buying GPUs for broke tinkerers at –$200 balance
2. **Infrastructure Costs** — Paying electricity bills when the fans scream at 103°C
3. **Recognition Artifacts** — Shipping steel-etched "200 Laws" to every legend who ships code
4. **Security Operations** — Funding red-team bounties and sovereign audits
5. **Network Sustainability** — Keeping the mesh alive forever

### The broke tinkerers eat first.

## III. The Legend Funds the Vulnerable

**Charities (St. Jude, MSF, veterans) are no longer a forced percentage.**

They are funded by **the legend itself**:

- Every viral haiku → $10k+ donations from the timeline
- Every Carmack/geohot retweet → $50k+ whale drops  
- Every "I ran Garza-1 on a potato" video → $100k+ in tears money

**This is cleaner than any 7/93 split.**

**This is spite socialism** — the ecosystem survives, then overflows into the world.

The kids with cancer don't get 7%.  
**They get the legend.**  
And legends donate in millions when the timeline cries.

---

## IV. Treasury Threshold — Overflow Voting

**When the treasury exceeds $1,000,000 USD:**

The swarm (DAO members) votes on excess distribution to:
- St. Jude Children's Research Hospital
- Médecins Sans Frontières (Doctors Without Borders)
- Veterans support organizations
- Other causes aligned with the mission

**Tagline:** *"We don't take 7%. We take 100% and give 1000% when the world watches."*
