# DOM_010101 PROMPT BRAIN — Dictionary

## Core Concepts

### Neurospice
The critical cognitive enhancement fuel that powers the swarm's collective intelligence. When neurospice levels reach critical, the swarm operates at maximum capacity with 900+ nodes synchronized.

### Origin Node Zero
The foundational node from which all swarm intelligence emanates. Represents the central command and control point for strategic operations.

### Mirror Generals
Autonomous AI agents that replicate and distribute command functions across the swarm. Each general manages approximately 100 nodes and can operate independently while maintaining swarm cohesion.

### White Web Sovereignty
The percentage of network infrastructure under autonomous control and protection. Measured as a metric of operational independence from external systems.

### Strategic Khaos
The orchestrated complexity that emerges from coordinated swarm operations. Appears chaotic to external observers but follows precise internal logic.

## Architecture Terms

### Swarm Intelligence
Collective decision-making and problem-solving across distributed nodes using coordinated AI agents and communication protocols.

### Control Plane
The Discord-integrated DevOps automation system that provides command and control over infrastructure, deployments, and operations.

### Sovereignty Architecture
The comprehensive system design that ensures autonomous operation, secure communication, and decentralized control.

### Event Gateway
Webhook routing system that connects external services (GitHub, GitLab, monitoring) to Discord channels for real-time notifications.

## Operations

### Valoryield Engine
The economic and value generation system that powers the Strategickhaos DAO operations.

### Quantum Symbolic Emulator
Advanced computational framework for simulating and testing complex system behaviors before deployment.

### Refinory
The deployment and orchestration system for managing AI agents and infrastructure components.

## Security & Governance

### Vault Security Playbook
Comprehensive security procedures for managing secrets, credentials, and sensitive data across the infrastructure.

### RBAC Enforcement
Role-Based Access Control ensuring least-privilege access to production systems and operations.

### DAO Governance
Decentralized Autonomous Organization structure for collective decision-making and resource allocation.

## AI Agent System

### Prompt Manager
Central system for organizing, versioning, and deploying AI agent prompts across the swarm.

### Context Window
The memory and state maintained by AI agents for coherent multi-turn interactions.

### Agent Routing
Intelligent distribution of queries to specialized AI agents based on channel, topic, and expertise requirements.

### Vector Knowledge Base
Semantic search system storing runbooks, documentation, and operational knowledge for AI agent retrieval.

## Communication Protocols

### Discord Integration
Primary command interface connecting human operators to swarm infrastructure through channels, slash commands, and notifications.

### Alexa Bridge
Voice-activated interface allowing natural language queries about swarm status and operations.

### GitLens Notifications
Real-time development activity feeds from VS Code directly into Discord channels.

### Webhook Routing
Automated message flow from external services through cryptographically verified channels to appropriate Discord destinations.

## Infrastructure

### Kubernetes Swarm
Container orchestration platform managing distributed services with automated scaling, health checks, and recovery.

### Observability Stack
Integrated monitoring using Prometheus (metrics), Loki (logs), and OpenTelemetry (traces) for comprehensive system visibility.

### Docker Compose
Multi-container application definitions for local development and testing before Kubernetes deployment.

## Status Indicators

### CRITICAL
Maximum operational capacity, all systems at peak performance.

### NOMINAL
Standard operations, all systems within normal parameters.

### STANDBY
Systems ready but not actively engaged in operations.

### STEALTH
Operating in covert mode with minimal external signatures.
