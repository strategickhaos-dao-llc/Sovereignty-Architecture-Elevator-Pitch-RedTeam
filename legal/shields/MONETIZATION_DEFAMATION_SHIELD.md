# Monetization & Defamation Shield

**Effective Date:** November 24, 2025  
**Applies To:** All Strategickhaos DAO LLC repositories, code, documentation, and public communications

---

## Purpose

This document provides legal protection for monetization activities, defamation defense, and speech rights for all contributors and users of Strategickhaos DAO LLC projects.

---

## I. Monetization Protection

### Commercial Speech Rights
All monetization activities, including but not limited to merchandise sales, licensing fees, royalties, sponsorships, donations, and paid services, are protected **commercial speech** under the First Amendment (Central Hudson Gas & Electric Corp. v. Public Service Commission, 447 U.S. 557).

### Royalty Terms
- **7% ValorYield:** All forks, derivative works, and commercial uses must preserve the 7% ValorYield attribution and royalty clause as specified in repository licenses.
- **Enforcement:** GPL v3 § 9 automatic acceptance clause ensures all users accept royalty terms upon use.
- **Trade Secrets:** Internal training logs, algorithms, and proprietary methods are protected trade secrets under Texas Uniform Trade Secrets Act (TUTSA).

### Right of Publicity Carve-Out
References to persons, brands, or companies in transformative, educational, or satirical contexts are protected under First Amendment fair use and transformative use doctrine (Cardtoons, L.C. v. Major League Baseball Players Ass'n, 95 F.3d 959).

### "Broke Tinkerer" Merchandise
All merchandise, branding, and commercial messaging using "broke tinkerer," "Empire Eternal," or similar phrases are protected commercial speech. Claims are truthful, not misleading, and serve public interest in innovation and education.

---

## II. Defamation Defense

### Truth as Absolute Defense
All statements made in repositories, documentation, and public communications are either:
1. **Factually true** (absolute defense under Texas Civ. Prac. & Rem. Code § 73.001), or
2. **Protected opinion** (Milkovich v. Lorain Journal Co., 497 U.S. 1)

### Pre-Suit Notice Requirement
Under Texas Civ. Prac. & Rem. Code § 73.005, any defamation claim must be preceded by 30-day written notice specifying allegedly false statements and demanding correction. We commit to:
- Reviewing all notices promptly
- Correcting genuine factual errors within 10 business days
- Invoking Texas Defamation Mitigation Act protections to minimize damages

### Anti-SLAPP Protection
Under Texas Citizens Participation Act (TCPA):
- **Early Dismissal:** Frivolous defamation suits targeting free speech will be dismissed within 60 days
- **Fee Shifting:** Plaintiffs who file baseless SLAPP suits must pay our attorney fees and costs
- **Sanctions:** Courts may impose additional sanctions on vexatious litigants

### Public Figure Doctrine
Statements about public figures, corporations, government officials, or matters of public concern receive heightened First Amendment protection (New York Times Co. v. Sullivan, 376 U.S. 254). Critics must prove **actual malice** (knowledge of falsity or reckless disregard for truth).

## III. Platform Immunity

### Section 230 Protection
Under 47 U.S.C. § 230(c)(1), we are not liable for user-generated content, third-party contributions, comments, pull requests, or issues posted by others.

### DMCA Safe Harbor

### No Prior Restraint
