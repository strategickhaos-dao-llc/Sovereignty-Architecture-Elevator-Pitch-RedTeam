## MICRO ENTITY CERTIFICATION

I hereby certify that I qualify for micro entity status under 37 CFR 1.29(a) and that all of the following statements are true:

### 1. Application Limit Certification (37 CFR 1.29(a)(1))

I certify that I, and each inventor (if a joint inventor), have not been named as the inventor or a joint inventor on more than four previously filed non-provisional patent applications, other than applications filed in another country, provisional applications under 35 U.S.C. 111(b), or international applications filed under the PCT for which the basic national fee under 35 U.S.C. 41(a) was not paid.

**For purposes of this certification:**
- Applications filed in the name of an employer, for which I was obligated by contract or law to assign rights, do not count toward the four-application limit
- Applications assigned to an institution of higher education are not counted
- Previously filed applications that have been withdrawn or abandoned are counted

☐ I have been named as inventor on **[___]** previously filed non-provisional patent applications (must be 4 or fewer)

### 2. Gross Income Certification (37 CFR 1.29(a)(2))

I certify that neither I, nor any inventor (if a joint inventor), in the calendar year preceding the calendar year in which the applicable fee is being paid, had a gross income, as defined in section 61(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, exceeding three times the median household income for that preceding calendar year, as most recently reported by the Bureau of the Census.

**For the year [YEAR]:**
- Median household income: $[Amount] (check current IRS/Census data)
- Three times median: $[Amount × 3]

☐ My gross income in [YEAR] was: $[___________] (must be less than 3x median)

**Gross income includes:**
- Wages, salaries, tips
- Business income
- Capital gains
- Interest and dividends
- Rental income
- Retirement distributions
- Social Security benefits (taxable portion)
- All other income reported on tax return

### 3. Assignment/License Certification (37 CFR 1.29(a)(4))

I certify that neither I, nor any inventor (if a joint inventor), has assigned, granted, or conveyed, and is not under an obligation by contract or law to assign, grant, or convey, a license or other ownership interest in the application concerned to an entity that, in the calendar year preceding the calendar year in which the applicable fee is being paid, had a gross income, as defined in section 61(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, exceeding three times the median household income for that preceding calendar year, as most recently reported by the Bureau of the Census.

☐ I have NOT assigned, granted, or licensed any rights to an entity exceeding the income threshold
☐ I am NOT under obligation to assign, grant, or license any rights to such an entity

**Note:** If you have assigned rights to an institution of higher education, you may still qualify under 37 CFR 1.29(d). Consult USPTO guidance for details.
