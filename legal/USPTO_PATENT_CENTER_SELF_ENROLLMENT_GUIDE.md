**Quick Start: Independent Inventor Self-Enrollment (USPTO Patent Center)**

This guide provides a concise step-by-step process tailored for independent inventors ("pro se") to self-enroll and gain full USPTO Patent Center access using ID.me.

---

## Prerequisites

Before beginning the enrollment process, ensure you have:

- **USPTO.gov account** - Create one at [USPTO.gov](https://www.uspto.gov/)
- **Identity verified via ID.me** - Complete verification at [ID.me](https://www.id.me/)

**Estimated Time:** Under 30 minutes

---

## Step 1: Log into Patent Center

1. Navigate to: [USPTO Patent Center](https://patentcenter.uspto.gov/)
2. Log in with your USPTO.gov account (after ID.me verification)
3. On first login, a pop-up will automatically start the self-enrollment process

**Troubleshooting:** If no pop-up displays:
- Contact Patent Electronic Business Center (EBC)
  - **Phone:** 866-217-9197
  - **Email:** ebc@uspto.gov

## Step 2: Select Your Role

Choose **Independent Inventor** if you represent yourself.

**Important:** Do NOT select "Registered Practitioner" unless you have passed the USPTO bar examination.

## Step 3: Customer Number Selection

### What is a Customer Number?

A Customer Number is a unique USPTO identifier used for:
- Patent correspondence management
- Access control to patent applications
- Communication with the USPTO

### Configuration Options

#### Option A: No Existing Customer Numbers

If you do not have existing customer numbers:

1. Select **"No"**
2. Review the information displayed
3. Check both confirmation boxes
4. Click **"Complete self-enrollment"**

**Note:** You can create a customer number later if needed:
- Navigate to: **"Manage"** → **"Manage customer numbers"** → **"Create new customer number"**

#### Option B: Existing Customer Numbers

If you have existing customer numbers:

1. Select **"Yes"**
2. Enter each customer number
3. Verify the customer number by providing one of the following:
   - Assigned Name
   - Phone Number
   - Zip Code
4. If verified successfully, review the displayed information

   - Retry the verification process
   - Skip and add the customer number later
   - Contact EBC for help

### Common Customer Number Errors

**"Customer number is already in use"**
- This means the customer number is already linked to another enrolled inventor or practitioner
- **Solution:** Customer numbers cannot be shared between accounts. Contact EBC to resolve the conflict.
