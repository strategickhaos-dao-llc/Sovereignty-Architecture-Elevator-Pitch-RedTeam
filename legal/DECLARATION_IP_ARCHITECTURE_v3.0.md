# DECLARATION OF TECHNICAL ARCHITECTURE AND INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY

Version 3.0 - Attorney Review Edition

**CONFIDENTIAL - ATTORNEY-CLIENT PRIVILEGED**

**Prepared for Legal Review Only - Not for Public Distribution**

## SECTION 0: EXECUTIVE SUMMARY FOR COUNSEL

### A. Who I Am & What I've Built

**Declarant:** Domenic G. Garza

**Entities:** StrategicKhaos DAO LLC (WY 2025-001708194) | ValorValor Engine 501(c)(3) (EIN 39-2923503)

**Core Achievement:** I've built a fully operational, self-hosted AI research and automation infrastructure that:

- Runs 130+ containerized services across 3 Kubernetes nodes (Nova, Lyra, Athena) with local AI models (Qwen2.5:72b), eliminating cloud dependencies while maintaining commercial AI integration (Claude, Grok, GPT, Gemini)
- Coordinates multiple AI systems through original prompt engineering frameworks and dialectical synthesis algorithms - what I call the "Legion of Minds Council"
- Automates portfolio management with AI-powered rebalancing, zero-trust validation, cognitive state gates, and 7% automated treasury allocation ("SwarmGate Protocol")
- Documents everything in 10,000+ Obsidian notes across 11 specialized vaults, creating comprehensive IP documentation trail

**Economic Model:** What traditionally requires 30-40 person teams, I run solo through AI-augmentation and cost reduction (my "880x Cost Reduction Model")

**New Additions (v3.0):**

- Ranks-style trading bot arsenal for 7% income generation, with Tier 0 deployable algos (Simple Momentum, Dual Momentum, etc.) integrated via Zapier webhooks to Slack/Sheets/Airtable/Alpaca
- QuantumEvoTokenizer (QET) as sovereign lab tool for log compression and pattern discovery in trading data
- Azure DevOps pipeline migrations for security hardening and CI/CD automation

### B. What I Need From Counsel

**Priority Actions Requested:**

- [ ] **Trademark Strategy** - Which 2-3 marks to file first (recommend: StrategicKhaos, SwarmGate, QET)
- [ ] **Copyright Protection** - Best approach for dialectical engine software + 100+ analogy mappings + trading algos
- [ ] **Patent vs Trade Secret Analysis** - Do novel methodologies (dialectical synthesis, multi-AI coordination, QET evo) warrant patent exploration or keep as trade secrets?
- [ ] **Entity Structure Review** - Optimal IP ownership between DAO board ↔ nonprofit ↔ me personally
- [ ] **Regulatory Compliance Audit** - DAO governance (WY law), 501(c)(3) ongoing compliance, automated trading (Pattern Day Trader rules, Regulation T), data protection (GDPR/CCPA applicability)
- [ ] **Licensing Framework** - Template for software licensing, API access, commercial use restrictions

**Timeline:** Planning trademark filings within 30-60 days; copyright registrations within 90 days; full IP strategy within 6 months.

**Budget:** Prepared to invest $5,000-$15,000 in initial IP protection and entity compliance.
