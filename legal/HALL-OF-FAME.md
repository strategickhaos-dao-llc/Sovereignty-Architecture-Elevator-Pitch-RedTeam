# 🏆 Legal Hall of Fame

## Lawyers & Legal Professionals Who Helped Make This Bulletproof

This page recognizes the legal professionals who contributed their time, expertise, and guidance to ensure our DAO → 501(c)(3) charitable royalty structure is IRS-compliant, court-tested, and built to last.

## 🎯 How We Work With Legal Professionals

**The Principle:** Lawyers armor the legal shell — the swarm runs the code.

We believe in:
- ✅ **Transparency**: All legal docs are public and open source
- ✅ **Collaboration**: Lawyers review, redline, and improve our work
- ✅ **Credit**: Public recognition for everyone who helps
- ✅ **Sovereignty**: Legal guidance never compromises DAO autonomy
- ✅ **Precedent**: Creating templates that help the entire ecosystem
