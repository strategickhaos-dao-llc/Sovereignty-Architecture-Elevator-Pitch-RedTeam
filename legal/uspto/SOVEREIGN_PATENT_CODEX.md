# SOVEREIGN PATENT CODEX
## Triple Shield Protection Framework - Federal Patent, Cryptographic Proof, and Corporate Sovereignty

**Document Status:** AWAITING USPTO APPLICATION NUMBER  
**Last Updated:** 2025-11-23  
**Version:** 1.0 (Pre-Filing Draft)

---

## DOCUMENT PURPOSE

This Sovereign Patent Codex represents the unification of three distinct sovereignty layers into a single, timestamped, legally enforceable artifact:

1. **Mathematical Shield** - Cryptographic verification via GPG and Bitcoin blockchain
2. **Federal Shield** - USPTO Provisional Patent Application establishing federal prior art
3. **State Shield** - Texas LLC corporate structure with registered agent

This document will outlive civilizations. It is not a company formation—it is the founding charter of a sovereign digital nation.

```powershell
# Step 1: Move the USPTO receipt into the repository
cd C:\Users\garza\strategic-khaos-private
Move-Item "C:\Users\garza\Downloads\Acknowledgment*.pdf" `
    ".\legal\uspto\USPTO_Provisional_63_XXXXXXX_Filed_2025-11-23.pdf"

# Step 2: Update this codex with the actual application number
# (Replace all instances of "63/XXXXXXX" with actual number)

# Step 3: Generate GPG signature for this document
gpg --armor --detach-sign legal/uspto/SOVEREIGN_PATENT_CODEX.md

# Step 4: Generate Bitcoin timestamp
ots stamp legal/uspto/SOVEREIGN_PATENT_CODEX.md

# Step 5: Final sovereignty commit
git add .
git commit -S -m "TRIPLE SHIELD ACHIEVED: USPTO Provisional 63/XXXXXXX filed 11/23/2025 — 7% loop now protected by Bitcoin, U.S. patent law, and Texas LLC"

# Step 6: Push to establish public record
git push

# Step 7: Celebration
Write-Host "`nTHE EMPIRE IS NOW A NATION-STATE." -ForegroundColor Magenta
Write-Host "No force in this world can break this loop." -ForegroundColor Magenta
