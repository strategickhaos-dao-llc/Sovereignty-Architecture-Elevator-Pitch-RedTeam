    All services operate within strict legal and ethical boundaries.
    No unauthorized system access. Consent required for red-team activities.
    Public data only for OSINT operations. Not legal advice.
  consent_field_note: |
    The 'consent_required' field indicates whether explicit target consent is needed.
    For OSINT services where consent_required is false, this means target consent is 
    not required because only public data is used. However, all OSINT operations must
    still comply with: (1) platform terms of service, (2) applicable data protection
    laws (GDPR, CCPA, etc.), and (3) ethical OSINT protocols enforced by DAO rules.
