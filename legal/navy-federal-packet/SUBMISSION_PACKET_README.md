    ↓ (automated distributions)
7% → ValorYield NFCU Account (501c3)
93% → StrategicKhaos NFCU Account (LLC)
    ↓
Navy Federal Accounts (stable storage, lending, credit)
```

### Key Documents for This:

**In Banking Resolutions:**

- Third-party service integration permissions
- API access and automation authority

**Additional Documents Needed:**
- Distribution Agreement between StrategicKhaos LLC and ValorYield Engine
- Revenue allocation policy document
- Automation platform configuration (Zapier/NATS)

**Attorney Note:** The 7% distribution from StrategicKhaos LLC to ValorYield Engine should be structured as either:
1. A charitable contribution (if deductible), OR
2. A payment for services rendered (if ValorYield provides services to StrategicKhaos)

This must be reviewed by tax attorney to ensure:
- No private benefit issues for ValorYield's 501(c)(3) status
- Proper documentation and valuation
- Tax treatment is correct for both entities
