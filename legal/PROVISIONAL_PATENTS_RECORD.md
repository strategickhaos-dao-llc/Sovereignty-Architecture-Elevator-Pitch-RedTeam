The protocol enables effective model training under extreme resource constraints by leveraging negative-balance computational budgets as training signals.

#### Key Innovations
- Resource constraint as feature engineering
- Negative-balance computational accounting
- Adaptive training under extreme limitations
- Efficient learning from minimal computational budgets

#### Technical Domain
- Machine Learning
- Neural Network Training
- Resource-Constrained Computing
- Computational Efficiency

### Application 2: Neurodivergent Biomimetic Multi-Agent Architecture

**Application Number**: U.S. Provisional 63/643,893  
**Title**: Neurodivergent Biomimetic Multi-Agent Architecture  
**Filing Date**: November 23, 2025

#### Abstract Summary
An architecture that directly translates neurodivergent cognitive patterns (specifically ADHD and autistic processing modalities) into multi-agent system design. The system creates silicon-based architectures that mirror the unique cognitive strengths of neurodivergent cognition, including hyperfocus, pattern recognition, parallel processing, and context-switching optimization.

#### Key Innovations
- Direct cognitive pattern translation to silicon
- ADHD-inspired attention management systems
- Autistic pattern-recognition architectures
- Neurodivergent-optimized multi-agent coordination
- Biomimetic cognitive load distribution

#### Technical Domain
- Multi-Agent Systems
- Cognitive Architecture
- Biomimetic Computing
- Distributed Intelligence
- Neurodiversity-Inspired Design
