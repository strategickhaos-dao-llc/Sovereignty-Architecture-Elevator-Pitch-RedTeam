## 2. FLAMELANG METHODOLOGY

### 2.1 Phase 1: Red Team Attack Simulation (Weeks 1-2)

**Step 1: FlameLang Security Modeling**
- Application architecture mapped as "coherent structure"
- Security boundaries identified using physics-informed analysis
- Trust boundaries modeled as black hole event horizons
- Information flow mapped using field theory principles

**FlameLang Analysis Outputs:**
```
Coherence Map:
├── Application Layer (Φ = 0.85)
├── API Boundary (Event Horizon β = 0.42)
├── Data Layer (Information Density ρ = HIGH)
└── External Interface (Hawking Radiation λ = 0.73)

Vulnerability Probability: P(v) = 1 - exp(-λ/β)
Critical Zones: [API Gateway, Session Manager, Auth Service]
```

**Step 2: Black Hole Boundary Analysis**
- Information leak detection using gravitational metaphor
- "Event horizon" boundaries where data should not escape
- Hawking radiation analogy for slow information leaks
- Schwarzschild radius calculations for critical secrets

**Key Insights:**
- Strong secrets (crypto keys) require high "gravitational pull"
- Session tokens have measurable "escape velocity"
- Information leak rate quantified as "radiation temperature"

**Step 3: Strain Tensor Analysis**
- Weak points identified by "stress" on security boundaries
- Authentication flows analyzed for "structural weakness"
- Input validation measured as "boundary resilience"
- Authorization logic assessed for "tensile strength"

**Step 4: Simulated Attack Execution**
- FlameLang-generated attack vectors
- Exploitation following predicted weak points
- Validation of theoretical vulnerabilities
- Evidence collection and documentation

### 2.2 Phase 2: Blue Team Defense Design (Week 3)

**Sovereignty Protocol Implementation:**
- Network isolation strategies (air-gap critical systems)
- Zero-trust architecture design
- Cryptographic boundary hardening
- Sovereign infrastructure deployment (no cloud dependencies)

**FlameLang Defense Models:**
```glyph
🔥 defense⟐auth {
    boundary: STRONG
    escape_velocity: HIGH
    monitoring: black_hole_radiation_detector
    mitigation: event_horizon_hardening
}
```

**Telemetry and Detection:**

- Behavioral analysis using coherence metrics
- Anomaly detection for "boundary violations"
- Incident response playbooks

**Defense Architecture:**
