## 8. COMMON INSURANCE QUESTIONS

### Q: Do I need insurance before signing my first client?

**A: YES.** Most clients (especially law firms and enterprises) will require proof of insurance before signing contracts. Professional liability and cyber liability are typically mandatory.

### Q: Can I get insurance after starting client work?

**A: Not recommended.** Most E&O policies are "claims-made" and won't cover prior acts. If you start work without insurance, claims from that work may not be covered even after you purchase insurance.

### Q: What if a client requires higher limits than I have?

**A: Options:**
1. Increase your policy limits (may be possible mid-term)
2. Purchase a separate policy for that specific engagement
3. Negotiate with client on acceptable limits
4. Decline the engagement if risk is too high

### Q: Should I get an umbrella policy?

**A: Consider if:**
- You have high-value engagements
- Clients require very high limits ($5M+)
- You want extra protection beyond primary policies
- Cost: $1,000-$3,000/year for $5M-$10M umbrella

### Q: Do contractors need their own insurance?

**A: YES.** 1099 contractors should carry their own E&O and cyber liability. Your policy likely won't cover them. Require proof of insurance before engaging contractors.

### Q: How do I know if my coverage is adequate?

**A: Factors to consider:**
- Typical engagement value (should cover 10x engagement size)
- Client requirements (many require $1M-$2M minimum)
- Industry standards (check what competitors carry)
- Risk tolerance (higher limits = more protection)
- Budget (balance cost vs. coverage)
