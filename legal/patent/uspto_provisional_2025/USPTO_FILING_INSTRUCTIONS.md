## IMPORTANT NOTES

### What a Provisional Patent Does

✅ **DOES:**
- Establishes priority filing date (11/23/2025)
- Creates prior art that prevents others from patenting
- Gives you "Patent Pending" status
- Provides 12-month window to file utility patent
- Legal evidence of invention date

❌ **DOES NOT:**
- Grant enforceable patent rights immediately
- Prevent others from using your invention (until utility patent granted)
- Last forever (expires in 12 months)
- Get examined by USPTO (provisional apps are not examined)
- Automatically convert to utility patent

### Critical Deadlines

**November 23, 2026 (12 months from filing):**
- **HARD DEADLINE** to file utility patent or PCT
- If you miss this date, you **LOSE ALL PATENT RIGHTS**
- Provisional application expires and becomes prior art only
- Cannot be extended or revived

**Recommendation:** Set multiple calendar reminders:
- 11 months from filing (reminder to start utility patent)
- 10 months from filing (urgency reminder)
- 9 months from filing (final warning)

### Confidentiality Warning

⚠️ **Your provisional application is CONFIDENTIAL**
- USPTO will not publish it
- It will not appear in public databases
- Only you and USPTO can see it

⚠️ **If you file a utility patent:**
- Your provisional content becomes public
- Everything in the provisional will be published
- Remove any sensitive information before utility filing

⚠️ **If you DON'T file a utility patent:**
- Provisional remains confidential forever
- It serves as prior art that only USPTO knows about
- No one else can see what you claimed
