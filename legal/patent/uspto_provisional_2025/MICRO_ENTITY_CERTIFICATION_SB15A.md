## APPLICANT CERTIFICATIONS (37 CFR 1.29(a))

I hereby certify that the applicant is eligible for micro entity status under 37 CFR 1.29(a) because the applicant meets each of the requirements of 37 CFR 1.29(a):

### Requirement 1: Qualification as a Small Entity (37 CFR 1.27)

☑ **CERTIFIED:** The applicant qualifies as a small entity under 37 CFR 1.27.

**Basis for Small Entity Status:**
- ☑ Individual inventor (not assigned to large entity)
- ☐ Small business concern (under 500 employees)
- ☐ Nonprofit organization

**Details:**
- Applicant is an individual inventor (Domenic Gabriel Garza)
- No assignment or obligation to assign rights to a large entity
- No licensing or obligation to license rights to a large entity
- Meets all small entity requirements under 37 CFR 1.27(a)

### Requirement 2: Application Limit (37 CFR 1.29(a)(2))

☑ **CERTIFIED:** The applicant has not been named as an inventor on more than four (4) previously filed patent applications, other than applications filed in another country, provisional applications, or international applications for which the basic national fee under 35 U.S.C. 41(a) was not paid.

**Verification:**
- Total previously filed applications naming this inventor: **0** (or fewer than 5)
- Excludes: Foreign applications, provisionals not converted, PCT applications without US national stage entry
- This is the inventor's [first / second / third / fourth] qualifying application

### Requirement 3: Gross Income Limit (37 CFR 1.29(a)(3))

☑ **CERTIFIED:** Neither the applicant nor the inventor nor a joint inventor has a gross income, as defined in section 61(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, exceeding three times the median household income for the preceding calendar year, as most recently reported by the Bureau of the Census.

**Income Threshold Verification:**

**For Calendar Year 2024 (most recent preceding year):**
- Median household income (2024): Approximately $74,580 (U.S. Census Bureau)
- Micro entity threshold (3x median): **$223,740**

**Applicant's Gross Income (2024):**
- Applicant (Domenic Gabriel Garza): **$[VERIFY: Less than $223,740]**
- No co-inventors: Not applicable
- All inventors' incomes below threshold: ☑ YES

**Sources of Income Considered (per IRC §61(a)):**
- Wages, salaries, tips
- Business income
- Investment income (interest, dividends, capital gains)
- Rents, royalties
- Alimony
- Other income reported on Form 1040

**Note:** This is GROSS income, not adjusted gross income (AGI). Use Line 9 of Form 1040, not Line 11 (AGI).

### Requirement 4: Large Entity Assignment (37 CFR 1.29(a)(4))

☑ **CERTIFIED:** Neither the applicant nor the inventor nor a joint inventor has assigned, granted, or conveyed, nor is under an obligation by contract or law to assign, grant, or convey, a license or other ownership interest in the application concerned to an entity that, in the calendar year preceding the calendar year in which the applicable fee is being paid, had a gross income, as defined by section 61(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, exceeding three times the median household income for the preceding calendar year, as most recently reported by the Bureau of the Census.

**Assignment Verification:**

**Current Ownership:**
- Inventor retains full ownership: ☑ YES
- No assignment to any entity: ☑ YES
- No license granted to any entity: ☑ YES
- No obligation to assign or license: ☑ YES

**Entity Income Verification (if any partial assignment):**
- Entity name (if applicable): Strategickhaos DAO LLC
- Entity 2024 gross income: **$[VERIFY: Less than $223,740]**
- Entity qualifies as micro entity: ☑ YES

**DAO Structure Note:**
The applicant is associated with Strategickhaos DAO LLC, a member-managed limited liability company. The DAO's gross income for calendar year 2024 did not exceed three times the median household income ($223,740). Therefore, any future assignment to the DAO would not disqualify micro entity status.

## FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS

**Q: What counts as "gross income" for this certification?**
A: All income reported on Form 1040, Line 9 (Total Income), before any adjustments or deductions. This includes wages, business income, investment income, etc.

**Q: Does my DAO's income count against me?**
A: Only if the DAO's income exceeds the threshold AND you've assigned rights to the DAO. If you maintain personal ownership, only your personal income matters.

**Q: What if I exceed the income limit next year?**
A: You must notify USPTO before paying any fees and switch to small entity or undiscounted rates. You can reclaim micro entity status in future years if you again qualify.

**Q: Can I file as micro entity if I'm starting a business?**
A: Yes, as long as you personally don't exceed the income limit and haven't assigned rights to an entity that exceeds the limit.

**Q: What if I'm not sure if I qualify?**
A: If uncertain, file as small entity (higher fee but still reduced) or consult a patent attorney. False certification risks patent enforceability.

**Q: How many times do I need to certify?**
A: Once at initial filing, then again only if your status changes. However, you must verify eligibility before each fee payment.

**Q: What if I have no income?**
A: You qualify under the income requirement. Still must meet the other three requirements.

**Q: Does student loan debt affect eligibility?**
A: No, debt is not considered. Only income matters for the income requirement.
