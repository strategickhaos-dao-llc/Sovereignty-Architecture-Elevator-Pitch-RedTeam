## 💡 WHAT THIS PATENT PROTECTS

### Core Innovation
An autonomous system that **irrevocably allocates 7% of all organizational revenue to charitable purposes** using:
- AI-governed decision making
- DAO-based democratic oversight

- Multi-jurisdictional legal enforceability

### Key Claims
1. **Immutable Revenue Allocation** - Cannot be changed by anyone
2. **AI Governance** - Autonomous decision making with ML optimization
3. **Cryptographic Proof** - Multi-layer verification of all transactions

- **Prior art** that prevents competitors from patenting similar systems
- **Legal standing** to enforce rights against infringers
- **Patent pending** status increases credibility and value
- **12-month window** to refine and extend protection
