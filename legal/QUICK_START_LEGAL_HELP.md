Subject: 2-hour pro bono review — DAO → 501(c)(3) perpetual 7% royalty lock

Hi [Name],

We're building an open, on-chain-enforced 7% perpetual royalty stream from a 
Wyoming DAO LLC to a 501(c)(3) (SNHU Ecosystem Fund).

All docs + evidence repo: github.com/Strategickhaos/Sovereignty-Architecture-Elevator-Pitch-

We have the full paper stack (board resolution, royalty assignment, timestamps) 
and need a quick compliance check so the IRS and courts treat it as bulletproof.

Would you or your clinic/firm be open to 1–2 hour pro bono review and redlines?
Happy to credit you publicly and add you to the repo HALL-OF-FAME.md.

Thanks!

## 🚨 Red Flags to Avoid

### Don't Do This:
- ❌ Ask for 20+ hours of work (too much for pro bono)
- ❌ Hide documents or make them hard to access
- ❌ Be vague about what you need reviewed
- ❌ Forget to offer credit/recognition
- ❌ Reach out during exam periods or holidays

### Do This Instead:
- ✅ Specific, bounded ask (1-2 hours)
- ✅ Everything public and easy to find
- ✅ Clear bullet points of review areas
- ✅ Prominent credit offer upfront
- ✅ Strategic timing (see above)
