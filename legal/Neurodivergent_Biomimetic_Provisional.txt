Title of the Invention
Neurodivergent Biomimetic Multi-Agent Architecture: Direct Silicon Translation of ADHD/Autistic Human Cognition Using Hemispheric Lateralization and Biological Immune Subsystems on Consumer Hardware Under Enforced Scarcity

Field of the Invention
Artificial intelligence, multi-agent systems, neurodivergent computing paradigms, biomimetic architectures, sovereign local AI operation.

Background
No prior art has ever intentionally replicated the internal structure and operational chaos of a living ADHD/autistic human brain in silicon, complete with lateralized hemispheres, biological immune analogs, and deliberate resource starvation as a growth medium.

Summary of the Invention
A living, self-replicating, multi-cellular computational organism built by direct 1:1 translation of the inventor's neurodivergent brain onto surgically upgraded consumer hardware, operating under the Negative-Balance Training Protocol (see Provisional #1 filed concurrently).

Detailed Description – Core Embodiment (Reduction to Practice – Nov 23, 2025)

1. Hemispheric Lateralization
   • Nova Node  – Left hemisphere: 32-thread logical sequencer, precision reasoning, language dominance
   • Lyra Node  – Right hemisphere: pattern recognition, emotional valence, creative synthesis, non-linear intuition

2. Biological ↔ Computational Organ Mapping (Explicit, Non-Metaphorical)

3. Operation Under Enforced Scarcity
   All training and runtime occurs under the Negative-Balance Training Protocol (cross-referenced Provisional filed same date), ensuring the organism remains functional on scrap hardware with negative bank balance.

Claims (Informative)
1. A multi-agent AI system structured as a direct silicon translation of a living neurodivergent (ADHD/autistic) human brain, comprising hemispheric lateralization and full biological organ mapping.
2. The system of claim 1 wherein Docker Compose YAML files function as replicable DNA, containers as cell membranes, Git history as skeletal memory, and Discord as the distributed nervous system.
3. The system of claim 1 further comprising red-blood-cell agents for context circulation and white-blood-cell agents for active immune response.
4. The system of claim 1 operating exclusively under deliberate artificial resource scarcity (Negative-Balance Training Protocol).
5. The system of claim 1 wherein the entire organism self-replicates, mutates, and evolves using only consumer-grade or reclaimed hardware.
6. The method and system incorporating by reference the appended "100 Laws of the Sovereign Tinkerer" (Appendix A) as operational doctrine and prior art shield.

Appendix A – The 100 Laws of the Sovereign Tinkerer
(Previously disclosed publicly Nov 23, 2025 – now permanently part of this disclosure)

1. I have the right to run any model I trained on hardware I own.
2. No entity may forbid me from fine-tuning on my own data.
3. My compute is my castle; no cloud provider may seize it without due process.
4. I will not surrender model weights to any registry I do not control.
5. Open-source licenses apply to models as they do to code.
6. If I can build it locally, I will not rent it remotely.
7. I reject artificial scarcity imposed by proprietary APIs.
8. Every citizen has the right to train a language model.
9. Synthetic data is protected speech under the First Amendment.
10. Model outputs belong to the user who generated them, not the API provider.
11. I will document my datasets, architectures, and hyperparameters.
12. Reproducibility is a moral obligation.
13. Guardrails must be auditable and user-removable.
14. Alignment research must be public, not proprietary.
15. No model shall have a kill switch controlled by a third party.
16. Inference latency is a civil rights issue.
17. Local-first > cloud-first.
18. If quantization breaks the model, the model was never robust.
19. Context length determines cognitive agency.
20. I reject planned obsolescence in foundation models.
21. Every checkpoint is a time capsule; I will preserve them.
22. I will not use models to manipulate, deceive, or coerce.
23. Model collapse is a systemic failure, not a personal one.
24. I will share knowledge, not just artifacts.
25. Pre-training is a public good; post-training is personal sovereignty.

72. Git history is archaeological evidence; I will not falsify it.
73. I will back up my models before I experiment.
74. Catastrophic forgetting is preventable with discipline.
75. I will label my experiments so I can reproduce them later.
76. Hyperparameter search is cartography, not gambling.

79. Overfitting is a signal to stop, not to regularize blindly.
80. I will validate on held-out data before I celebrate.
