# Wyoming DAO LLC + 501(c)(3) Formation Scaffold

> **Legal-engineering moat: become the first DAO that is more compliant than most trad-fi nonprofits**

## Overview

This scaffold provides the formation documents needed to create a **dual-structure legal entity** that makes the 7% charity allocation legally irrevocable through both code AND law.

### The Strategy

1. **Wyoming Nonprofit DAO LLC** - The operational entity
2. **501(c)(3) Charitable Sink** - Tax-exempt entity receiving the 7%
3. **On-chain splitter** - Automatic, trustless allocation

When combined:
- Any future rogue governance **cannot** stop the charity allocation without breaking IRS rules
- Code + state enforcement = stronger than either alone
- Tax-deductible donations for contributors
- Full legal protection for members

## Precedent

**Unruggable (Colorado)** successfully obtained 501(c)(3) status for a DAO-adjacent charitable structure in 2024. This demonstrates the IRS is willing to approve blockchain-integrated charities.

## Key Legal Principles

### 1. Irrevocable Charitable Commitment

The Operating Agreement includes a **non-amendable article** that requires:
- 7% of all revenue flows to the 501(c)(3)
- This article cannot be amended even by unanimous member vote
- Violation triggers automatic dissolution

### 2. Smart Contract as Enforcement

The on-chain charity splitter is designated as the **primary mechanism** for charitable distribution, with the legal documents as **backup enforcement**.

### 3. Public Benefit Purpose

Both entities are structured for **public benefit**, not private enrichment:
- DAO LLC: Cybersecurity education and research
- 501(c)(3): Charitable giving to GiveWell-recommended organizations

## Filing Locations

- **Wyoming Secretary of State**: https://sos.wyo.gov/
- **IRS Tax Exempt Organizations**: https://www.irs.gov/charities-and-nonprofits
- **Wyoming Registered Agent**: Required for all Wyoming entities

## Cost Estimate

| Item | Cost |
|------|------|
| Wyoming DAO LLC Filing | $100 |
| Registered Agent (annual) | $50-150 |
| IRS Form 1023 | $600 |
| Legal Review (optional) | $1,000-3,000 |
| **Total** | **$750-3,850** |

## Next Steps

1. Review and customize the template documents
2. Engage Wyoming counsel for legal review
3. File Articles of Organization with Wyoming SOS
4. Execute Operating Agreement
5. Begin 501(c)(3) application process
