## 📋 Executive Summary

Students with ADHD in federally-funded higher education institutions are protected by multiple layers of federal law requiring reasonable accommodations, prohibiting discrimination, and banning retaliation for self-advocacy. This document compiles 100+ legal authorities establishing that:

1. **ADHD qualifies as a disability** under ADA/Section 504
2. **Reasonable accommodations are mandatory**, including extended deadlines and reduced penalties
3. **AI/assistive technology use is protected** as a cognitive accommodation tool
4. **Self-advocacy and disclosure are protected activities** under anti-retaliation provisions
5. **Universities must engage in an interactive process** when accommodations are requested
6. **Denial without justification constitutes discrimination** (no intent required per recent precedent)

## 🏛️ LEGAL HIERARCHY & AUTHORITY STRUCTURE

### Tier 1: U.S. Supreme Court Precedent
**Binding on all federal and state courts**

### Tier 2: Federal Statutes & Regulations
**Applicable to all federally-funded institutions**

### Tier 3: Federal Agency Guidance (OCR/DOJ)
**Authoritative interpretations with enforcement power**

### Tier 4: Circuit & District Court Decisions
**Binding within jurisdictions, persuasive elsewhere**

### Tier 5: State Law Enhancements

## ⚖️ TIER 1: SUPREME COURT PRECEDENT

### 1. Southeastern Community College v. Davis
**Citation**: 442 U.S. 397 (1979)  
**Holding**: Qualified students with disabilities cannot be denied access to educational programs unless accommodations would "fundamentally alter" the program's essential requirements.  
**Application**: Late submissions, extended deadlines, and reopened modules constitute minor adjustments, not fundamental alterations. This precedent anchors all subsequent ADA/504 interpretation in educational contexts.  
**Significance**: Core precedent - ends debate on whether accommodations are optional.

### 2. AJT v. Osseo Area Schools
**Citation**: U.S. Supreme Court (2025)  
**Holding**: Overturns "animus" requirement for discrimination claims under Section 504/IDEA. Simple denial of accommodations = discrimination, without need to prove bad faith or discriminatory intent.  
**Application**: Universities cannot defend accommodation denials by claiming lack of intent to discriminate. Failure to accommodate is per se discrimination.  
**Significance**: Game-changer - removes intent barrier from disability discrimination claims.

## 🚨 PRACTICAL APPLICATION FRAMEWORK

### Interactive Process Requirements

When student discloses ADHD and requests accommodations, institution MUST:

1. **Engage in dialogue** about accommodation needs
2. **Consider external documentation** (medication records, prior accommodations, life context)
3. **Explore available options** without prejudgment
4. **Provide written response** explaining decisions
5. **Implement reasonable accommodations** unless fundamental alteration demonstrated
6. **Prohibit retaliation** in any form

### Protected Disclosures Include:

- ADHD diagnosis documentation
- Medication records (Vyvanse, other prescriptions)
- Prior accommodation history
- Academic performance context (GPA, Dean's List, degree progress)
- Life circumstances affecting academic performance
- Cognitive architecture/tool disclosures (AI use, organizational systems)
- DAO/business entity filings (if relevant to time management/executive function)

### University CANNOT:

- Accuse student of "cheating" or "gaming the system" for using documented accommodations
- Deny accommodations without demonstrating fundamental alteration
- Retaliate through grade reductions or academic dishonesty claims
- Ignore accommodation requests with supporting documentation
- Treat AI/assistive technology use as misconduct when disclosed and documented
- Penalize self-advocacy or disclosure of disability status

### Student Rights:

- Request accommodation at any time (including after grades assigned)
- Share own academic records in support of request
- Use AI/assistive technology with appropriate disclosure
- File OCR complaints for denial or retaliation
- Seek retroactive accommodations and grade adjustments
- Pursue legal action for violations
