## 1. Overview and Background

I am the founder and principal of **StrategicKhaos DAO LLC** (Wyoming DAO LLC, File No. 2025-001708194), a decentralized autonomous organization focused on AI-augmented research, automation, and algorithmic trading. I am also the founder of **ValorYield Engine** (501(c)(3) Nonprofit Corporation, EIN 39-2923503), a related entity dedicated to educational and charitable initiatives in emerging technologies.

I have developed and operate a proprietary self-hosted AI infrastructure, including original software systems such as:

- **Strategickhaos Dialectical Engine** – a Python-based contradiction-resolution framework;
- **QuantumEvoTokenizer (QET)** – an adaptive tokenization engine for data patterns and log analysis; and
- **SwarmGate Protocol** – an automated treasury governance system with a 7% allocation rule.

These assets support operational trading strategies generating revenue through integrations with platforms such as Kraken, NinjaTrader, Coinbase, and Alpaca.

To protect and scale these assets, I seek comprehensive legal counsel at the intersection of:

- **Intellectual Property (IP):** software/AI protection (copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, potential patents);
- **Tax-Exempt Organizations:** ensuring 501(c)(3) compliance, including UBIT analysis for automated trading activities; and
- **FinTech/Crypto/DAOs:** regulatory compliance for Wyoming DAO governance, algorithmic trading (Reg T, Pattern Day Trader rules), and inter-entity IP licensing.

This RFP solicits proposals from qualified firms with demonstrated expertise in these areas, preferably with offices in Texas (Houston, Austin, or Dallas) or strong national capabilities. Proposals will be evaluated based on expertise, approach, team composition, timeline, and cost-effectiveness. Short-listed firms will receive a full **Declaration of Technical Architecture and Intellectual Property Ownership (v3.1)** for deeper due diligence under NDA.
