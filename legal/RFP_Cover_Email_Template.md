Dear [Firm / Attorney Name],

My name is Domenic Garza. I am the founder of StrategicKhaos DAO LLC (a Wyoming DAO LLC) and ValorYield Engine (a 501(c)(3) nonprofit). I am seeking a firm that can advise at the intersection of:

- AI/software intellectual property (copyright, trademarks, and potential patents),
- Nonprofit and UBIT compliance for a 501(c)(3) with some automation/trading exposure, and
- FinTech/crypto/DAO regulation, including Wyoming DAO governance and algorithmic trading rules.

Attached is a Request for Proposal outlining the scope of services I am seeking, along with a high-level declaration of my current technical architecture and IP portfolio.

If your firm is interested and has capacity to take on this matter in Q1 2026, I would appreciate a proposal by December 20, 2025, or a brief response suggesting an alternative timeline.

I am happy to schedule an introductory call to provide additional context and answer questions.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Best regards,  
Domenic G. Garza  
Founder, StrategicKhaos DAO LLC & ValorYield Engine
