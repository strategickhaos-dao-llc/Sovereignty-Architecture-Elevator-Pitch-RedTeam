## ⭐ THE 4 PATHS TO BECOME A REGISTERED INVENTOR

You only need ONE of these paths to establish your inventor status:

### **OPTION 1: File a Provisional Patent Application** ⭐ **RECOMMENDED FIRST STEP**

This is the **cheapest**, fastest, and most accessible path to real "inventor status."

#### **What is a Provisional Patent?**

A provisional patent application:
* Protects your idea for **12 months**
* Lets you mark your invention as **"Patent Pending"**
* Sets your **official inventor timestamp** (priority date)

* Can be drafted by you (the inventor)
* Is NOT examined by the USPTO
* Can be converted to a full non-provisional patent within 12 months

#### **Costs (Micro-Entity Qualification)**

* **Filing Fee: $65**

**Note:** USPTO fees are subject to change. Verify current fees at: https://www.uspto.gov/learning-and-resources/fees-and-payment/uspto-fee-schedule

You qualify as a micro-entity if:
- You're a student, OR
- You have low income (less than 3x median household income), OR
- You're filing fewer than 4 previous patent applications, OR
- You have not assigned or licensed the invention to a large entity

#### **Requirements**

1. **Title of Invention**
   - Clear, descriptive name for your invention
   
2. **Written Description**

## ⚖️ **Legal Considerations**

### **Inventor Status**

- You must be the actual inventor (or one of them)
- Inventorship cannot be transferred (only ownership can)
- False claims of inventorship are fraud
- All inventors must be listed

### **Public Disclosure**

- Filing a provisional gives you 12 months of protection
- Without filing, public disclosure can invalidate future patent rights
- Trade shows, publications, sales count as public disclosure
- File BEFORE publicly disclosing when possible

### **Confidentiality**

- Provisional applications are NOT published by USPTO
- They remain confidential unless you reference them in a published non-provisional
- Use NDAs when discussing with potential partners/investors
