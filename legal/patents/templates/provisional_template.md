## Background

### Problem Statement

[Describe the problem your invention solves. What are the limitations of current solutions?]

**Key questions to answer**:
- What problem does your invention solve?
- Why is this problem important?
- What are the current approaches and their limitations?
- Why is a new solution needed?

### Prior Art

[Briefly describe existing solutions or technologies in this area. This helps establish what is novel about your invention.]

**Example**:
> Traditional charitable distribution systems rely on centralized organizations with manual decision-making processes. While some automated systems exist, they typically lack transparency, verifiable governance mechanisms, and cryptographic proof of charitable intent. Existing blockchain-based solutions have focused primarily on cryptocurrency transactions without addressing the specific needs of charitable distribution and tax compliance.
