## 📝 USPTO Filing Process

### Step 1: Prepare Application Materials

1. **Title of Invention:**
   - "Sovereignty Architecture with Cryptographic Philanthropic Loop Mechanism"
   - Alternative: "Distributed Autonomous Philanthropy Engine with Triple-Layer Sovereignty Protection"

2. **Technical Field:**
   - Computer-implemented systems for distributed autonomous organizations
   - Cryptographic security and blockchain timestamping
   - Philanthropic fund allocation mechanisms

3. **Background/Problem Statement:**
   - Prior art in DAO structures lacks triple-layer sovereignty protection
   - Existing philanthropic mechanisms lack cryptographic guarantees
   - Need for immutable, timestamped proof of architectural design

4. **Summary of Invention:**
   - A sovereignty architecture combining:
     - **Cryptographic Layer:** Bitcoin timestamping, GPG signatures, OpenTimestamps
     - **Federal Layer:** USPTO provisional patent protection
     - **State Layer:** Texas/Wyoming LLC legal structure
   - 7% philanthropic loop mechanism with cryptographic guarantees
   - Distributed autonomous organization with constitutional AI constraints

5. **Detailed Description:**
   - Include relevant documentation from repository:
     - `SOVEREIGNTY_COMPLETE_V2.md`
     - `dao_record.yaml`
     - `cognitive_architecture.svg`
     - `ai_constitution.yaml`
   - Technical implementation details of cryptographic timestamping
   - Federal and state legal compliance framework

6. **Claims (Provisional - can be refined later):**
   - A system for establishing cryptographic sovereignty over digital architecture
   - A method for immutably protecting philanthropic fund allocation percentages
   - A triple-layer protection mechanism combining mathematics, federal law, and state law

### Step 2: File via USPTO Portal

1. **Access USPTO EFS-Web:**
   - Navigate to: https://www.uspto.gov/patents/apply/filing-online
   - Create account or log in

2. **Select Application Type:**
   - Choose: "Provisional Application for Patent"
   - Application Type: "Utility Patent"

3. **Complete Online Forms:**
   - **Applicant:** Strategickhaos DAO LLC / Valoryield Engine
   - **Inventor:** Domenic Gabriel Garza
   - **Correspondence Address:** Use Principal Address above
   - **Filing Fee:** Check current provisional application fee (typically $75-$300 depending on entity size)

4. **Upload Documents:**
   - Specification (PDF format)
   - Drawings (if applicable - include cognitive_architecture.svg)
   - Cover sheet (auto-generated by system)

5. **Review and Submit:**
   - Verify all information is correct
   - Pay filing fee
   - Submit application

6. **Receive Confirmation:**
   - Save USPTO acknowledgment receipt

## 🔐 Post-Filing Actions

After receiving your USPTO application number, immediately execute the post-filing script to:
1. Archive the USPTO receipt with proper naming convention
2. Create cryptographically signed Git commit
3. Push to repository with sovereignty declaration

### For Windows (PowerShell):
See: `post-filing-script.ps1`

### For Unix/Linux/macOS (Bash):
See: `post-filing-script.sh`

## 📜 Sovereign Patent Codex Generation

Once USPTO filing is complete, the **Sovereign Patent Codex** will be generated, merging all proof layers:

### Codex Components:
1. **Cryptographic Proofs:**
   - Manifest SHA256 hash
   - GPG key fingerprint
   - Bitcoin timestamp (.ots file)
   - OpenTimestamps verification

2. **Federal Protection:**
   - USPTO Provisional Application Number
   - Filing date
   - Inventor declaration

3. **State Protection:**
   - Texas LLC registration details
   - Wyoming SF0068 compliance
   - Formation documents

4. **Operational Framework:**
   - 7% philanthropic loop mechanism
   - Constitutional AI constraints
   - Governance structure

See: `SOVEREIGN_PATENT_CODEX_TEMPLATE.md` for the complete codex structure.

## ⚠️ Important Notes

### Priority Date
- Filing a provisional application establishes a **priority date** for your invention
- You have **12 months** from filing date to file a non-provisional application
- The provisional application is **not examined** but establishes prior art

### Confidentiality
- Keep your USPTO application number confidential until you're ready to disclose
- The provisional application is **not published** by USPTO
- You control when/if to disclose the invention

### Next Steps After Filing
1. Execute post-filing script immediately
2. Generate Sovereign Patent Codex
3. Archive all filing materials in secure location
4. Calendar the 12-month deadline for non-provisional filing
5. Consider international protection (PCT application)

### Legal Counsel
- While provisional applications can be self-filed, consider consulting a patent attorney for:
  - Non-provisional application preparation
  - Claims refinement
  - Prior art searches
  - International filing strategy
