## Related Documentation

### Pre-Print Publication
- **Document**: Thysanotus Brown 1810.htm
- **GPG Signed**: Thysanotus Brown 1810.htm.gpg
- **Signature Timestamp**: 23:47 PST, November 23, 2025
- **Key Fingerprint**: 9F3A 2C8B D407 1810
- **Storage**: Proton Drive (end-to-end encrypted)
- **DOI**: Assigned via Zenodo

### Cryptographic Provenance
The pre-print document was cryptographically signed using GPG at the exact timestamp as the second provisional patent filing, establishing multiple independent timestamped records of the intellectual property.

## Prior Art Establishment

The combination of USPTO provisional filing, Zenodo DOI assignment, GPG cryptographic signature, and Proton Drive encrypted storage creates multi-layered prior art protection:

1. **Federal Record**: USPTO filing timestamp
2. **Academic Record**: Zenodo DOI and pre-print
3. **Cryptographic Record**: GPG signature with timestamp
4. **Secure Storage**: End-to-end encrypted backup

## Legal Notes

### Priority Date
The provisional patent applications establish a priority date of November 23, 2025 for the claimed inventions. Per 35 U.S.C. § 119(e), the applicant has 12 months from this date to file a non-provisional application while maintaining this priority date.

### Prior Art Documentation
The GPG-signed pre-print provides cryptographically verifiable prior art documentation that:
- Cannot be backdated (cryptographic timestamp)
- Cannot be modified without detection (GPG signature verification)
- Is independently verifiable (multiple storage locations)
- Meets court admissibility standards (federal and cryptographic evidence)

### Charitable Commitment
As documented in the founding documents of Strategickhaos DAO LLC, 7% of all revenues derived from these patents and related intellectual property are irrevocably committed in perpetuity to support pediatric cancer research and treatment.

## Filing Circumstances

### Resource Constraints
These applications were filed under extraordinary circumstances:
- **Budget**: Negative bank balance ($-32.67)
- **Infrastructure**: Consumer-grade laptops
- **Cooling Issues**: Systems operating at 99°C
- **External Support**: Zero investors or institutional backing

### Sovereignty Principle
The filing demonstrates that meaningful intellectual property protection can be achieved without:
- Institutional affiliation
- Venture capital funding
- Cloud infrastructure investment
- Corporate legal departments

Using only:
- Open source tools (GPG)
- Consumer hardware
- Privacy-focused services (Proton Drive)
- Public academic infrastructure (Zenodo)
- Federal patent system (USPTO)

## Verification

### Independent Verification Methods
The intellectual property claims can be independently verified through:

1. **USPTO PAIR System**: Public Access to Patent Application Information
2. **Zenodo Repository**: DOI resolution and document retrieval
3. **GPG Signature**: Cryptographic verification using public key
4. **Timestamp Correlation**: Multiple independent system timestamps

### Public Key
For GPG signature verification:
```
Key Fingerprint: 9F3A 2C8B D407 1810
```
