## Risk Management

### Potential Issues
1. **Priority Date Loss**: Miss conversion deadline → mitigation: calendar reminders, attorney engagement
2. **Prior Art Discovery**: Existing patents found → mitigation: thorough search, attorney review
3. **Claim Rejection**: USPTO rejects claims → mitigation: detailed specifications, attorney support
4. **Budget Constraints**: Insufficient funds for conversion → mitigation: grant applications, licensing

### Mitigation Strategies
- Set multiple calendar reminders for critical dates
- Maintain detailed documentation of all innovation activities
- Build financial reserve for patent costs
- Consider patent attorney engagement 6 months before deadline
- Explore grant opportunities for patent funding
- Document all prior art discovered
- Maintain inventor notebooks with dated entries
