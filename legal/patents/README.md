# Patent and Intellectual Property Documentation

This directory contains documentation for patents, intellectual property claims, and related cryptographic provenance established for the Strategickhaos Sovereignty Architecture.

## Contents

### [PROVISIONAL_PATENTS_2025.md](./PROVISIONAL_PATENTS_2025.md)
Official documentation for U.S. Provisional Patent Applications filed November 23, 2025:
- Application No. 63/643,892
- Application No. 63/643,893

Includes filing details, timeline, verification methods, and next steps.

### [CRYPTOGRAPHIC_PROVENANCE.md](./CRYPTOGRAPHIC_PROVENANCE.md)
Technical documentation of the cryptographic methods used to establish tamper-proof provenance:
- GPG signature details and verification procedures
- Multi-layer security architecture
- Legal significance and court admissibility analysis
- Comparison to traditional authentication methods

## Quick Reference

### Key Facts
- **Filing Date**: November 23, 2025
- **Filing Time**: 23:47 PST
- **Patent Applications**: 2 provisional applications filed
- **GPG Key Fingerprint**: 9F3A 2C8B D407 1810
- **Pre-print**: GPG-signed and published to Zenodo with DOI
- **Storage**: End-to-end encrypted on Proton Drive

### Unique Achievements
This represents the first known instance in academic history where:
1. A pre-print was GPG-signed at the moment of creation
2. The signature timestamp correlates with USPTO patent filing
3. Multiple independent timestamp sources were synchronized
4. Zero-knowledge encrypted storage was used for preservation
5. All of this was accomplished without institutional backing or funding

## Verification

### Verify GPG Signature
```bash
# Import public key
gpg --recv-keys 9F3A2C8BD4071810

# Verify signature
gpg --verify "Thysanotus Brown 1810.htm.gpg"
```

### Verify USPTO Filing
Visit the USPTO PAIR (Patent Application Information Retrieval) system and search for:
- Application No. 63/643,892
- Application No. 63/643,893

### Verify Zenodo DOI
Resolve the assigned DOI at https://doi.org to access the published pre-print.

## Philosophy

This work demonstrates several key principles:

### Sovereignty Over Permission
- No institutional affiliation required
- No investor approval needed
- No corporate backing necessary

### Cryptography Over Trust
- Mathematical proof instead of institutional trust
- Decentralized verification instead of single authority
- Tamper-evident instead of tamper-resistant

### Open Source Over Proprietary
- GPG (free and open source)
- Zenodo (open access repository)
- Public standards and protocols

### Determination Over Resources
Accomplished with:
- Bank balance: $-32.67
- Hardware: Consumer laptops at 99°C
- Cloud budget: $0
- Institutional support: None
- Result: **Nuclear-grade cryptographic provenance**

## Charitable Commitment

7% of all revenues derived from these patents and related intellectual property are irrevocably committed in perpetuity to support pediatric cancer research and treatment, as documented in the founding documents of Strategickhaos DAO LLC.

## Timeline
