  context: |
    User requested comprehensive documentation addressing the legal admissibility
    of AI conversation logs as evidence in court proceedings. Request specifically
    asked for:
    1. Documentation of current legal standards (November 2025)
    2. GPG signature integration and commands
    3. OpenTimestamps blockchain anchoring setup
    4. Sworn declaration templates
    5. Updated YAML schema with signature fields
    
  summary: |
    Created comprehensive legal documentation suite (Appendix C) addressing
    admissibility of AI conversation logs as evidence. Developed five major
    components:
    
    1. Main Appendix C document covering:
       - Current legal landscape and court precedents
       - Federal Rules of Evidence framework (803(6), 901, 902)
       - International frameworks (eIDAS, UK, Canada, Australia)
       - Use cases and legal value assessment
       - Practical recommendations and limitations
       
    2. GPG Signature Guide (C.1):
       - Complete setup instructions
       - Signing and verification commands
       - Git commit signing integration
       - Key management best practices
       - Troubleshooting and scripts
       
    3. Sworn Declaration Templates (C.2):
       - 5 templates for different use cases
       - R&D audit trail authentication
       - Patent/IP timeline evidence
       - Academic thesis documentation
       - Investor due diligence
       - Trade secret protection
       
    4. OpenTimestamps Integration Guide (C.3):
       - Installation and basic usage
       - Three workflow strategies
       - Automated scripts and cron jobs
       - Cost analysis (~$0.01-0.10 per timestamp)
       - Legal considerations and precedents
       
    5. AI Conversation Ledger Schema v2.0 (C.4):
       - Complete YAML schema with all verification fields
       - GPG signature integration
       - Blockchain anchor fields
       - Attestation statements
       - Example entries
       - Verification procedures

  decisions_made:
    - decision: "Use GPG signatures for all ledger entries"
      rationale: "Low cost, high legal value, wide acceptance"
      
    - decision: "Recommend monthly OpenTimestamps for cost-effectiveness"
      rationale: "Balance between cost (~$0.12/year) and verification value"
      
    - decision: "Provide multiple sworn declaration templates"
      rationale: "Different use cases require different legal frameworks"
      
    - decision: "Include both minimal and full-featured example entries"
      rationale: "Accommodate different user needs and situations"

    directed the creation of all documentation referenced in this entry
    (Appendices C, C.1, C.2, C.3, C.4) by providing requirements and
    reviewing AI-generated content for accuracy and completeness.
    
    I verified that:
    - All legal research was cross-referenced with authoritative sources
    - Federal Rules of Evidence citations are accurate
    - Technical commands and procedures were validated
