# Entity Separation Plan

## INTERNAL DRAFT — NOT LEGAL ADVICE — ATTORNEY REVIEW REQUIRED

## Current Situation

### Strategickhaos DAO LLC
- **Status**: Administratively Dissolved
- **Dissolution Date**: November 2025
- **Reason**: Failed to provide DAO Public Identifier within 30 days
- **Prior EIN**: 39-2900295 (issued to now-dissolved entity)
- **Operational History**: None (no filings, accounts, contracts, or revenue)

### ValorYield Engine
- **Entity ID**: 2025-001708312
- **Type**: Nonprofit Corporation
- **Status**: Active/Unaffected by DAO dissolution
- **EIN**: Not yet obtained (required)

## Why Separation is Critical

1. **Tax Compliance**: Different tax treatments (LLC vs 501(c)(3))
2. **Liability Isolation**: Separate legal protections
3. **Mission Clarity**: DAO governance vs charitable operations
4. **Regulatory Requirements**: Different state/federal obligations

## Three-Step Fresh Start Plan

### Step 1: File NEW Strategickhaos DAO LLC

**Requirements**:
- Include DAO Public Identifier from day one (see DAO_PUBLIC_IDENTIFIER.md)
- Deploy smart contract BEFORE filing
- Use contract address as DAO Public Identifier
- No mention of ValorYield Engine in formation documents

**Timeline**: 
- [ ] Prepare governance smart contract
- [ ] Deploy to testnet for testing
- [ ] Deploy to mainnet
- [ ] File new Wyoming DAO LLC with contract address
- [ ] Submit formation with DAO Public Identifier included

**Outcome**: New Wyoming DAO LLC with separate EIN

### Step 2: Get Separate EIN for ValorYield Engine

**Current Status**: Incorporated but no EIN
- Entity ID: 2025-001708312
- Formation complete
- Needs federal tax identification

**Action Items**:
- [ ] Complete IRS Form SS-4 for ValorYield Engine
- [ ] Apply as nonprofit corporation
- [ ] Obtain separate EIN (not 39-2900295)
- [ ] Begin 501(c)(3) application process

**Outcome**: ValorYield Engine with dedicated EIN, ready for 501(c)(3) application

### Step 3: Maintain Clean Separation

**Governance**:
- Separate operating agreements
- Separate bank accounts
- Separate accounting systems
- Separate board/member structures where applicable

**Documentation**:
- No co-mingling of entity names in records
- Clear identification on all documents
- Separate tax filings (when applicable)

**Outcome**: Two entities, two EINs, no confusion

## EIN Clarification

| Entity | EIN Status | Notes |
|--------|------------|-------|
| Strategickhaos DAO LLC (OLD) | 39-2900295 | Entity dissolved - EIN now orphaned |
| Strategickhaos DAO LLC (NEW) | TBD | Will need new EIN after formation |
| ValorYield Engine | TBD | Needs first EIN - no prior number |

**Important**: EIN 39-2900295 was issued to an entity that no longer exists. This EIN should NOT be used for any purpose. A new EIN must be obtained for any refiled entity.

## Timeline Benefits

**Clean Slate Advantages**:
- ✅ No tax returns to amend
- ✅ No bank accounts to close
- ✅ No contracts to unwind
- ✅ No revenue recognition issues
- ✅ No liability carryover
- ✅ No creditor complications

**Smart Contract Deployment Timeline Intact**:
- Original deployment plans can proceed
- Contract address becomes DAO Public Identifier
- Governance system ready at formation

## Next Actions

1. **Immediate**: Confirm ValorYield Engine active status
2. **Week 1**: Prepare governance smart contract
3. **Week 2**: Test contract on testnet
4. **Week 3**: Deploy to mainnet, obtain address
5. **Week 4**: File new Wyoming DAO LLC with DAO Public Identifier
6. **Week 5**: Apply for new EINs for both entities
7. **Month 2**: Begin 501(c)(3) application for ValorYield Engine
