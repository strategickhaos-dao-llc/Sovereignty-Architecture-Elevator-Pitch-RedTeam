# ADHD Accommodation Quick Reference Guide

**Purpose**: Fast-access guide for student self-advocacy  
**Companion Document**: [ADHD_ACCOMMODATION_LEGAL_FRAMEWORK.md](./ADHD_ACCOMMODATION_LEGAL_FRAMEWORK.md)  
**Use Case**: Preparing accommodation requests to universities

## 🚀 TL;DR - Your Legal Rights

**YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO:**
✅ Request accommodations at any time (even after grades are assigned)  
✅ Use AI and assistive technology with appropriate disclosure  
✅ Share your academic records to support your request  
✅ Request extended deadlines and reduced penalties  
✅ Have modules/assignments reopened for completion  
✅ Be free from retaliation for requesting accommodations  

**UNIVERSITIES MUST:**
✅ Engage in an interactive process with you  
✅ Consider your documentation and context  
✅ Provide reasonable accommodations unless they fundamentally alter the program  
✅ Respond to your requests in writing  
✅ Not accuse you of "cheating" for using disclosed accommodations  

**NO INTENT REQUIRED**: As of 2025, universities don't need bad intent to violate your rights - simple denial = discrimination (AJT v. Osseo)

## 🎯 The 5-Minute Accommodation Request Template

### Subject Line:
```
Formal Request for ADHD Accommodations - [Your Name] - [Course/Program]
```

### Email Body Structure:

**1. DISCLOSURE (2 sentences)**
```
I am a student with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), 
a condition that substantially limits major life activities including 
concentration, task initiation, and time management. I am formally 
requesting reasonable accommodations under Section 504 of the 
Rehabilitation Act (29 U.S.C. § 794) and the Americans with Disabilities 
Act.
```

**2. DOCUMENTATION (bullet list)**
```
I am providing the following documentation:
• ADHD diagnosis from [provider/date]
• Current medication prescription (Vyvanse/other)
• Academic performance record (GPA: X.XX, Dean's List [if applicable])
• Degree progress documentation (Degree Works: XX% complete)
• [Any prior accommodation records]
```

**3. SPECIFIC ACCOMMODATIONS REQUESTED**
```
I respectfully request the following reasonable accommodations:
• Extended deadlines for [specific assignments/modules]
• Reopening of [Module X] for completion
• Reduced late penalties for documented ADHD-related delays
• [Acceptance of AI-assisted work with proper disclosure]
• Academic adjustments per 34 C.F.R. § 104.44
```

**4. LEGAL CONTEXT (1-2 sentences)**
```
These accommodations are supported by precedent including Southeastern 
Community College v. Davis (442 U.S. 397), Guckenberger v. Boston University, 
and recent OCR Resolution Agreement: [University name if applicable]. 
Extended deadlines and module reopening constitute minor adjustments, 
not fundamental alterations to program requirements.
```

**5. INTERACTIVE PROCESS REQUEST**
```
I am willing to engage in an interactive process to determine appropriate 
accommodations. I request a written response within [10 business days] 
outlining approved accommodations or, if denied, the specific reasons why 
the requested accommodations would fundamentally alter program requirements.
```

**6. CONTACT INFO**
```
Thank you for your attention to this matter.

[Your Name]
[Student ID]
[Email]
[Phone - optional]
```

**7. ATTACHMENTS**

## 🛡️ Anti-Retaliation Shield

### If Accused of "Gaming the System" or "Cheating"

**Your Response:**
```
My use of [AI tools/accommodations/disclosed methods] is a reasonable 
accommodation for my documented ADHD disability, protected under 
Section 504 (29 U.S.C. § 794) and ADA anti-retaliation provisions 
(42 U.S.C. § 12203).

Treating my disability disclosure and accommodation request as 
"academic dishonesty" constitutes prohibited retaliation under 
34 C.F.R. § 104.61. See OCR v. Purdue Global (2024) and Singh v. 
George Washington University (D.D.C. 2005).

I request immediate cessation of these accusations and accommodation 
of my documented disability. I am prepared to file an OCR complaint 
if retaliation continues.
```

## 🔥 High-Leverage Examples

### Example 1: SNHU Student (Direct Precedent)
**Fact**: SNHU settled OCR Docket 01-18-2377 (2019) for ADHD/anxiety accommodation failures  
**Your Leverage**: "SNHU is already under OCR mandate to accommodate ADHD requests after the 2019 settlement. Denial would constitute repeat violation subject to enhanced penalties."

### Example 2: Capella/Online Universities
**Fact**: OCR v. Capella (2023) forced retroactive penalty waivers for ADHD late work  
**Your Leverage**: "Online universities like Capella were required to waive penalties and reopen modules for ADHD students. This is established OCR policy for online education."

### Example 3: AI/Assistive Technology
**Fact**: DOE AI Report (2023) + DOJ Online Accessibility (2024) recognize AI as accommodation  
**Your Leverage**: "Federal guidance recognizes AI tools as legitimate cognitive accommodations when disclosed. My transparent use of [tool] with proper citation is protected accommodation, not misconduct."

## 📊 Red Flags That Indicate Violation

🚩 **University refuses to consider your documentation**  
→ Violation: Failure to engage in interactive process

🚩 **University demands "proof of bad intent" before accommodating**  
→ Violation: AJT v. Osseo (2025) eliminated intent requirement

🚩 **University threatens academic dishonesty charges for disclosed AI use**  
→ Violation: Anti-retaliation (42 U.S.C. § 12203)

🚩 **University says "too late" for retroactive accommodations**  
→ Violation: OCR consistently requires retroactive grade adjustments

🚩 **University says accommodations would be "unfair to other students"**  
→ Violation: ADA requires individualized assessment, not comparison to non-disabled

🚩 **University ignores accommodation request entirely**  
→ Violation: Nathanson v. Medical College (duty to investigate)

## 💡 Pro Tips

### Documentation Best Practices
✅ **Save everything**: All emails, letters, forms  
✅ **Use certified mail**: For critical requests (creates proof of receipt)  
✅ **Request written responses**: "Please respond in writing"  
✅ **Note phone calls**: Date, time, person, summary - follow up with email confirmation  
✅ **Organize chronologically**: Timeline matters for OCR complaints

### Communication Strategies
✅ **Stay professional**: Emotion-free, fact-based language  
✅ **Cite law frequently**: Shows you know your rights  
✅ **Request specific**: "Reopen Module 2" not "help with grades"  
✅ **Set deadlines**: "Please respond by [date]"  
✅ **Copy appropriate offices**: Disability Services, Dean of Students, Registrar

### What NOT to Do
❌ Don't accept "policy prohibits" without question (policies can violate law)  
❌ Don't agree to withdraw instead of accommodations (your right to accommodations)  
❌ Don't let them rush you into decisions  
❌ Don't sign away your right to file complaints  
❌ Don't accept "we've never done this before" as a reason (law requires it)

## 🎓 Specific Scenarios

### Scenario: Failed Course Due to Late Work
**Request**: Grade recalculation with ADHD-related late penalties waived  
**Cite**: Maples v. UT Medical Branch (retakes not fundamental alteration)  
**Precedent**: OCR v. Capella (retroactive penalty waivers required)

### Scenario: Module Closed, Need Reopening
**Request**: Technical reopening of module for completion  
**Cite**: Push v. Western Michigan (ordered module reopening)  
**Precedent**: OCR v. Quinnipiac (must consider late work with documentation)

### Scenario: AI Tool Flagged as Plagiarism
**Request**: Review under accommodation framework, not academic dishonesty  
**Cite**: DOE AI Report 2023 (AI as accommodation), OMB M-24-10  
**Defense**: Disclosed use + citation = accommodation, not misconduct

### Scenario: "Too Much Accommodation Requested"
**Response**: ADA requires individualized assessment  
**Cite**: Davis (only denial = "fundamental alteration" shown)  
**Counter**: University must explain how each accommodation alters program

### Scenario: Retaliation After Request
**Action**: Document retaliation, file OCR complaint immediately  
**Cite**: 42 U.S.C. § 12203, 34 C.F.R. § 104.61  
**Precedent**: OCR v. Purdue Global (retaliation prohibited)
