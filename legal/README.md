## 🔑 Key Legal Concepts

### What We're Building
A **perpetual 7% charitable royalty** from a Wyoming DAO LLC to a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization (SNHU Ecosystem Fund).

### Key Legal Requirements

#### IRS Compliance
- **Form 8283**: Noncash Charitable Contributions
- **Form 8899**: Notice of Income from Donated Intellectual Property
- **IRC Section 170**: Charitable contribution deduction rules
- **Appraisal Requirements**: For property valued over $5,000

#### State Law Compliance  
- **Wyoming SF0068**: Decentralized Autonomous Organization Supplement
- **DAO LLC Structure**: Legal entity formation and governance
- **Charitable Gift Laws**: State-level gift acceptance rules

#### Governance Documentation
- **Board Resolutions**: Authorizing the charitable gift
- **Royalty Assignment Agreement**: Legal transfer document
- **Gift Acceptance Policy**: Nonprofit procedures for accepting gifts
- **Donor Intent Documentation**: Preserving the purpose of the gift

## 💡 Why Professional Legal Help Matters

### What the IRS and Courts Expect

When you cross these thresholds, professional guidance is **not optional**:

- ✅ Assigning ongoing royalty streams (not just one-time gifts)
- ✅ IP or future revenue potentially worth >$5,000–$10,000
- ✅ Donor claiming any tax deduction now or later
- ✅ Charity filing Form 8899 correctly

### What Lawyers Provide

**Legal Professionals Will:**
- Review documents for IRS compliance
- Suggest language improvements
- Identify risks and mitigation strategies
- Provide citations to relevant law and precedent
- Red-line problematic clauses

**But They Won't Control:**
- Your DAO's governance decisions
- On-chain smart contract execution
- Community voting mechanisms
- Technical implementation
- Day-to-day operations

**The Key Principle:** Lawyers armor the legal shell — the swarm still runs the code.
