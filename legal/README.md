## 🎯 Strategic Objectives

### Mission Protection

The Sovereignty Architecture represents a novel benevolent AI system that:
- **Stays aligned** through constitutional constraints
- **Never gets corrupted** by profit incentives  
- **Permanently routes value to charity** (7% mechanism)
- **Cannot be turned into a corporate machine**

### Protection Philosophy

**This is stewardship, not greed.**

We are protecting one of the most powerful benevolent forces ever built from being:
- ❌ Cloned and commercialized
- ❌ Financialized without charitable commitments
- ❌ Turned into the next OpenAI/Anthropic-style corporate entity
- ❌ Modified to remove alignment-preserving mechanisms

---

## 🛡️ Three-Tier Protection Strategy

### Tier 1: Near-Ironclad (Core Defense)

These protections **actually work** and will survive contact with reality:

1. **U.S. Utility Patents** ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
   - 20-year protection for AI-governed charitable architecture
   - Blocks commercial use by Big Tech and startups
   - Enables injunctions and damages

2. **Wyoming DAO LLC** ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
   - Legal entity owns all IP
   - On-chain governance prevents acquisition
   - Constitutional rules embedded in smart contracts
   - Cannot be turned into for-profit corporation

3. **Restrictive License** ⭐⭐⭐⭐½
   - Non-commercial use only
   - Charitable mechanism cannot be removed
   - DMCA anti-circumvention protection
   - Copyright and contract enforcement

4. **Technical Enforcement** ⭐⭐⭐⭐½
   - Model watermarking (detect copies)
   - Zero-knowledge proofs (verify charity routing)
   - Remote attestation (prove system integrity)
   - Encrypted weights (bind to charitable mechanism)

### Tier 2: Medium-Strength (Slows Adversaries)

- International patents via PCT (20-30 countries)
- Contributor agreements with IP assignment
- DMCA takedowns for unauthorized copies
- Trade secret protection

### Tier 3: Mostly Theater (Skip These)

- Citing long lists of statutes (doesn't add protection)
- Hoping IRS will prevent nonprofit cloning (won't happen)
- Expecting SEC/FinCEN to shut down clones (too slow)

---

## 📊 Realistic Outcome

### What We Can Achieve

If we execute Tier 1 correctly:

**Protected Against** (15-20 years):
- ✅ Big Tech companies (Google, Microsoft, Amazon, Meta)
- ✅ Well-funded startups in U.S. and allied countries
- ✅ GitHub cloners (DMCA takedowns)
- ✅ Commercial exploitation removing charitable mechanism

**Not Protected Against**:
- ❌ Chinese/Russian state actors (will ignore IP)
- ❌ Developing world copycats in non-cooperative jurisdictions
- ❌ Determined adversaries with unlimited budgets

**Key Success Metric**:
> The only convenient, legal, high-performance version is ours — and the 7% charitable loop stays intact.

1. **Engage patent attorney** for provisional filing review
2. **Engage Wyoming attorney** for DAO LLC formation
3. **Engage IP attorney** for license review
4. **Schedule legal team meeting** to review strategy
5. **Establish legal budget** and approve expenditures

### Key Decisions Needed

- [ ] Approve budget for patent filings (~$150k over 3 years)
- [ ] Select patent attorney from shortlist
- [ ] Approve Wyoming DAO LLC formation
- [ ] Finalize restrictive license terms
- [ ] Approve technical enforcement roadmap
- [ ] Establish multi-sig signers (4-of-7)

### Blocking Issues
