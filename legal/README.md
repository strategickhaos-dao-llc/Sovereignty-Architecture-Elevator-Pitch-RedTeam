# Legal Shield for Strategickhaos Ecosystem

This directory contains the legal shield documentation for the Strategickhaos / SwarmGate ecosystem.

## Purpose
Provides comprehensive legal protections, compliance mappings, and disclaimers for software, open-source, cybersecurity, and DAO-related activities. It ensures the project operates within safe, verifiable boundaries, focusing on digital rights, privacy, and distributed systems.

## Key Files
- **LEGAL_SHIELD.yaml**: Core legal configuration, jurisdictions, controls, clauses, and policies.
- **governance_appendix.yaml**: DAO-specific governance details, including voting and contracts.
- **bundle.tar**: Deterministic archive for hashing and on-chain commits.

## Usage
1. Review LEGAL_SHIELD.yaml for compliance in your jurisdiction.
2. Integrate provenance and publication policies into workflows.
3. For commits: Tar the bundle, compute BLAKE3 hash, upload to IPFS, and execute on-chain commit.
4. Handle incidents per response process.

## Disclaimers
- This is not legal advice—consult professionals.
- Scope: Software/cyber/DAO only; no medical/biotech claims.
- All components open-source under MIT (no warranty/liability).
