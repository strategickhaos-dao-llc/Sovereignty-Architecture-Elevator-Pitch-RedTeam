If you need a **separate mailing address** (PO Box, mail forwarding service, etc.), you can use one for certain purposes. However:
- Always maintain the Longview street address as your official business address
- Use Longview address for all legal and regulatory filings
- Mailing address should be in addition to, not instead of, the street address

## Record Keeping

Maintain a file with:
- Copies of all federal applications with Longview address
- EIN confirmation letter
- USPTO correspondence
- Federal tax filing copies
- Bank account opening documents

This ensures you can verify address consistency if any agency questions arise.
