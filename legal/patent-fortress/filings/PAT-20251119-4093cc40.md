## DETAILED DESCRIPTION

### Technical Implementation

The system comprises:

1. **Automated Discovery**: Continuous monitoring of code repositories for novel 
   implementations and methodologies

2. **Pattern Recognition**: Analysis of commits, code changes, and architectural 
   decisions to identify patentable subject matter

3. **Defensive Filing**: Rapid provisional patent generation to establish prior art 
   and prevent unauthorized commercialization

4. **Open-Source Integration**: Dual licensing model allowing open collaboration 
   while maintaining intellectual property protection

### Novel Features

- Real-time patent discovery from version control systems
- Automated provisional application generation
- Integration with royalty scanning and enforcement
- AI-powered innovation detection
