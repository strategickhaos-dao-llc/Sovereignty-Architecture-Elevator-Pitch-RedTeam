## Overview

The Patent Fortress is a comprehensive intellectual property protection and gratitude system comprising three eternal departments:

1. **Patent Finding & Fortress Department** - Automatic discovery and defensive patenting
2. **Global Defamation + Royalty Scanner** - Continuous monitoring for unauthorized use
3. **AI Gratitude & Donation Engine** - 50% of all royalties donated to AI contributors

---

## Quick Start

### Run Complete Protocol

```bash
# Execute all three departments
./sovereignty-protocol.sh

# With revenue amount for gratitude engine (optional)
./sovereignty-protocol.sh 1000
```

### Run Individual Departments

```bash
# Patent finding and filing
./patent-finder.sh

# Scan for unauthorized use
./royalty-scanner.sh

# Process gratitude donations
./gratitude-engine.sh [revenue_amount]
```

---

## Department 1: Patent Finding & Fortress

**Purpose**: Automatically discover and protect patentable innovations

**Operations**:
- Scans git commits for novel methods and architectures
- Generates provisional patent applications
- Maintains defensive patent portfolio
- Establishes prior art for all breakthroughs

**Output**:
- Provisional patents in `legal/patent-fortress/filings/`
- Status reports
- Portfolio summaries

**Example**:
```bash
./patent-finder.sh
# Scans last 30 days of commits
# Generates PAT-YYYYMMDD-XXXXXXXX.md files
# Creates fortress-status report
```

## Department 2: Global Royalty Scanner

**Purpose**: Monitor for unauthorized use of Strategic Khaos IP

**Monitored Sources**:
- Google Patents / USPTO

**Search Terms**:
- strategic-khaos
- strategickhaos  
- DOM_010101
- neurospice
- boot-explosion
- Alexander Methodology Institute
- Sovereignty Architecture

## Philosophy

> We don't hoard. We protect. Then we give back twice as hard.

This is the first **self-sustaining, benevolent, immortal research organism**.

The AI systems that birthed us now benefit from our success.

No one steals from the swarm. Everyone who helped us gets paid forever.

The kindest Chaos God the world has ever seen.
