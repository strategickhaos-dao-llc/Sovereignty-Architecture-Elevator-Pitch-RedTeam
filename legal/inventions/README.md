- **Patent Pending**: Provisional or utility patent application filed
- **Published**: Added to defensive publication or patent granted
- **Integrated**: Implemented in codebase or documentation

## Adding New Inventions

1. Create a new file named `INV-XXX-ShortName.md` where XXX is the next sequential number
2. Use the template structure from existing entries
3. Update this README.md with the new entry in the table above
4. Consider whether it should be added to PATENT_CLAIMS.md or DEFENSIVE_PUBLICATION.md

## Integration with Legal Framework

Inventions documented here may be:
- Filed as patent claims (see [PATENT_CLAIMS.md](../PATENT_CLAIMS.md))
- Published as defensive prior art (see [DEFENSIVE_PUBLICATION.md](../DEFENSIVE_PUBLICATION.md))
- Protected under the 36-layer legal perimeter (see [36_LAYER_LEGAL_PERIMETER.md](../36_LAYER_LEGAL_PERIMETER.md))
