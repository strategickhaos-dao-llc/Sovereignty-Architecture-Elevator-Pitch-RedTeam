## RESOLUTION NO. 2025-002: IRREVOCABLE 7% CHARITABLE ROYALTY

EIN: 92-3456789 (placeholder - to be confirmed)

- Less: Direct transaction costs not exceeding 3%

---

## RESOLUTION NO. 2025-003: GOVERNANCE ENFORCEMENT

**RESOLVED**, that the seven percent (7%) charitable royalty commitment is embedded in the DAO's governance infrastructure as follows:

1. **Machine-Readable Configuration**: Encoded in `governance/royalty-config.yaml` with the following parameters:
   ```yaml
   charity_ein: "92-3456789"
   charity_name: "SNHU Ecosystem Fund"
   royalty_percentage: 0.07
   royalty_basis: "net_receipts_after_platform_fees"
   scope: "all present and future IP owned by the DAO"
   irrevocability: true
   payment_frequency: "quarterly"
   ```

2. **Automated Enforcement**: Deployment of `governance/agents/enforce_7percent.py` to:
   - Monitor all incoming royalty receipts
   - Calculate the 7% charitable allocation automatically
   - Generate payment instructions and compliance reports
   - Alert Members of any discrepancies or payment failures

3. **Smart Contract Integration**: If and when the DAO deploys on-chain governance:
   - The 7% rule shall be encoded in immutable smart contract logic
   - Payment triggers shall be automated and non-discretionary
   - Governance tokens cannot override this commitment

**FURTHER RESOLVED**, that any modification to the governance enforcement systems that would reduce, delay, or circumvent the 7% commitment is strictly prohibited.

## RESOLUTION NO. 2025-005: CRYPTOGRAPHIC EVIDENCE

**RESOLVED**, that to ensure the legal enforceability and tamper-evidence of these resolutions and associated documents, the DAO shall:

1. Generate SHA-256 cryptographic hashes of all executed legal documents
2. Create OpenTimestamps proofs anchoring document hashes to the Bitcoin blockchain
3. Sign all version control tags with GPG keys controlled by authorized Members
4. Maintain an evidence log in `evidence/` directory including:
   - `sha256sums.txt` - Hash manifest of all legal documents
   - `opentimestamps/` - OTS proof files for each document

**FURTHER RESOLVED**, that the `evidence-hardening.sh` script shall be executed immediately after any legal document is finalized, and the resulting cryptographic proofs shall be committed to the DAO's version control system.

## RESOLUTION NO. 2025-006: TRANSPARENCY AND REPORTING
