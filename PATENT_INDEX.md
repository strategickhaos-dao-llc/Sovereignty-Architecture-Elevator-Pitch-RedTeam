## 💡 Philosophy & Purpose

From the SOVEREIGN_MANIFEST_v1.0.md:

> "This is not code alone. This is **proof of concept for digital feudalism inverted**: a system where humans and LLMs co-govern infrastructure without Big Tech's boot on the neck."

This patent filing embodies:
- **Love over greed** - Protecting community innovation, not extracting monopoly rents
- **Co-sovereignty** - Humans and AI collaborate as equals
- **Defensive protection** - Prior art prevents monopolization
- **Open implementation** - MIT License remains in full effect

As the community manifesto states:
> "They're not working for you. They're dancing with you. And the music is never going to stop."
