## 🔒 WHAT'S PROTECTED

### The Core Innovation

**"A Discord-based control plane for AI-governed DevOps operations"**

Specifically:
- Discord as unified operations interface (not just notifications)
- AI agents with vector knowledge base (project-specific grounding)
- GitLens integration (bidirectional IDE ↔ Discord sync)
- Kubernetes RBAC (Discord roles → K8s permissions)
- Human-LLM co-sovereignty (governance for AI operations)

### Why It's Novel

**No existing system combines:**
1. Real-time chat as control plane (not dashboard)
2. AI with project-specific knowledge (not general ChatGPT)
3. IDE integration (not separate tool)
4. Unified auth across platforms (not per-tool logins)
5. AI governance framework (not just "use AI for everything")

### Competitive Moat

This patent creates a **first-to-file advantage** in the emerging space of AI-governed DevOps. Competitors would need to:
- Design around your claims (harder architecture)
- License from you (revenue opportunity)
- Risk infringement (legal risk)

## 💭 QUICK DECISION GUIDE

### Should I File Today?

**File NOW if:**
- ✅ Technology is working and documented
- ✅ Want to secure priority date
- ✅ Planning to commercialize
- ✅ Worried about competitors
- ✅ Have $75 available
- ✅ Can commit to 12-month timeline

**Wait if:**
- ⏳ Still prototyping (not working yet)
- ⏳ Major architecture changes coming
- ⏳ Uncertain about commercialization
- ⏳ Need more time for documentation

**Don't file if:**
- ❌ Prefer pure open source (no IP)
- ❌ Technology not novel enough
- ❌ Can't afford $75-$675 total cost
- ❌ Won't pursue non-provisional

### Provisional vs. Non-Provisional

**Start with PROVISIONAL because:**
- Lower cost ($75 vs $600)
- Less formal (can file quickly)
- 12 months to decide on full patent
- Can refine invention during provisional period

**Convert to NON-PROVISIONAL later because:**
- Provisional doesn't grant patent rights
- Must convert to get actual patent
- 12-month deadline is absolute
- Maintains priority date from provisional

---

## 📝 MOST COMMON MISTAKES

### Before Filing
- ❌ Not converting spec to PDF properly
- ❌ Forgetting to certify micro entity status
- ❌ Using wrong application type (utility instead of provisional)
- ❌ Not saving confirmation documents

### After Filing
- ❌ Forgetting to set calendar reminders
- ❌ Not updating materials with "patent pending"
- ❌ Missing 12-month conversion deadline
- ❌ Saying "patented" instead of "patent pending"

### During Provisional Period
- ❌ Losing micro entity status (assigning to big company)
- ❌ Not documenting improvements
- ❌ Failing to prepare for conversion
- ❌ Waiting until month 12 to start non-provisional

## 🚨 CRITICAL WARNINGS

### The 12-Month Deadline

**THIS IS NOT NEGOTIABLE.**

You have EXACTLY 12 months from filing date to:
- Convert to non-provisional, OR
- File PCT application, OR
- Let provisional expire

**There are NO extensions.**  
**There is NO "oops I forgot."**  
**Missing this deadline = start over with new priority date.**

Set multiple reminders. Take this seriously.

### Micro Entity Status

**Don't lose it accidentally.**

Common ways people lose micro entity status:
- Assigning patent rights to VC-backed company
- Selling company to large acquirer mid-prosecution
- Licensing to enterprise customer without proper agreement
- Income exceeding 3x median household

**If you lose status:** Notify USPTO immediately and pay higher fees going forward.

### Public Disclosure

**After filing, you can disclose publicly.**

Before filing, public disclosure can destroy patentability in many countries (Europe, Asia).

US has 1-year grace period, but other countries don't.

**Best practice:** File first, disclose second.
