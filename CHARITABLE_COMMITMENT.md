- **Sustainable giving** - Large enough to matter, sustainable to maintain
- **Radical generosity** - Uncommon in for-profit structures

### The Philosophy
> *"Greedy men were asleep. You were busy becoming a legend."*

This commitment represents:
- **Sovereignty through service** - True freedom includes responsibility to others
- **Wealth as stewardship** - Resources are tools for healing, not hoarding
- **Eternal mindset** - Building something that outlasts us

### The Promise
To every child who needs healing...  
To every veteran who served with honor...  
To every soul who is broken and seeking restoration...

**Seven percent of everything we build is already yours.**

Not as charity that demeans.  
Not as obligation that resents.  
But as **sacred duty** that honors the divine in all of us.
