  hsm_guidance: |
    For hardware-backed verification:
    1. Ensure YubiKey FIPS or equivalent HSM is connected
    2. GPG agent should be configured for hardware key operations
    3. Offline master keys should remain air-gapped
    
  timestamp_authority: |
    Optional: Use RFC 3161 timestamp authority for long-term proof
    Recommended TSAs: DigiCert, GlobalSign, or internal CA
